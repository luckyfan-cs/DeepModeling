# Mamo Ode 221 Consider An Lrc Circuit That Consists Of An Inductor A Resistor And

Consider an LRC circuit that consists of an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor connected in series. The values of the inductance, resistance, and reciprocal capacitance are \(6.759\) henries, \(6.458 \Omega\), and \(1/0.739 F^{-1}\) respectively. At time zero, the charge on the capacitor is \(3.0 C\) and the current flowing through the circuit is \(-3.945 A\). What would be the charge on the capacitor at time \(t = 5s\)? Assume that an increase in current from negative to positive terminal signifies a positive direction. Provide your answer rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

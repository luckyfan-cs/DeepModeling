# Mamo Easy 143 A Military Commander Is Planning To Allocate Resources Between Two

A military commander is planning to allocate resources between two types of units, X and Y. The allocations must be in whole numbers due to the nature of the units. To achieve a strategic objective, twice the strength of unit X plus unit Y must be at least 10. However, there are resource constraints that limit the combined strength of unit X and four times unit Y to not more than 50. Each unit of X and Y requires 5 and 3 support points respectively, and the commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total support points required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole number.

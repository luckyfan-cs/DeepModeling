# Mamo Ode 216 Consider An Rlc Circuit Where The Inductor Resistor And Capacitor A

Consider an RLC circuit where the inductor, resistor, and capacitor are connected in series. The inductance of the circuit is \(8.126\) henry, the resistance is \(5.024 \Omega\), and the capacitance is \(0.411 F\). Initially, the charge on the capacitor is \(4.0 C\) and the current flowing through it is \(3.276 A\). Assuming no external voltage source, find out how much charge will be on the capacitor at time \(t = 7 s\). Consider a positive direction for increasing charge. Express your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

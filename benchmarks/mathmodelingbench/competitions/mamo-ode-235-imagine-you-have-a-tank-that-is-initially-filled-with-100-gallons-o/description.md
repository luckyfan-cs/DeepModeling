# Mamo Ode 235 Imagine You Have A Tank That Is Initially Filled With 100 Gallons O

Imagine you have a tank that is initially filled with 100 gallons of water, containing Q_0 = 50 pounds of salt dissolved in it. Fresh water, which contains a quarter-pound (1/4 lb) of salt per gallon, is being added to the tank at a constant rate of r = 3 gallons per minute. To keep the total volume of water in the tank unchanged at 100 gallons, the tank is drained at the same rate. The goal is to model the amount of salt in the tank, referred to as Q(t), over time, and specifically determine the amount of salt, in pounds, in the tank after 20 minutes. Keep four significant digits in the answer

# Mamo Easy 393 A School Is Planning The Allocation Of Its Budget Across Four Diff

A school is planning the allocation of its budget across four different departments: Technology (T), Physics (P), Sports (S) and Research (R). The costs associated with each unit of allocation for these departments are \$500, \$300, \$200 and \$100 respectively. However, there are certain constraints that must be adhered to due to the school's policies and requirements:\n\n- The combined budget allocation for Technology and Physics cannot exceed 50 units.\n- Similarly, the combined budget allocation for Sports and Research cannot exceed 30 units.\n- At least 15 units must be allocated to Technology to ensure adequate technological resources for students.\n- At least 10 units should go towards Physics to maintain high-quality education in this discipline.\n- A minimum of 5 units is required by the Sports department to facilitate physical activities and sports events.\n- Lastly, at least 2 units must be allocated to Research as it forms a crucial part of academic progression.\n\nThe school aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints. Also note that due to administrative reasons, only whole numbers of units can be allocated to each department. What would be the minimum total cost incurred by the school given these conditions? Provide your answer in dollars rounded off to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

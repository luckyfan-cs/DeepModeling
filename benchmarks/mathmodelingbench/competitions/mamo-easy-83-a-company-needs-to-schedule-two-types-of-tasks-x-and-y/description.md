# Mamo Easy 83 A Company Needs To Schedule Two Types Of Tasks X And Y

A company needs to schedule two types of tasks, $X$ and $Y$. Each task of type $X$ takes 8 hours to complete, while each task of type $Y$ takes 5 hours. The total number of tasks cannot exceed 10 due to resource limitations. To meet a certain business requirement, the combined effort for these tasks must yield a minimum effectiveness score calculated as twice the number of tasks of type X plus thrice the number of tasks of type Y, which should be at least 6 points. Given that all task counts must be whole numbers due to their indivisible nature, what is the minimum total time in hours required to complete all the tasks while meeting all constraints?

# Mamo Easy 491 In A Military Strategy Planning A Commander Needs To Allocate Reso

In a military strategy planning, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units: X and Y. The total number of units that can be supported is limited due to logistical constraints. Each unit of X requires 1000 support points and each unit of Y requires 2000 support points respectively.\n\nThe following conditions must be met:\n- The combined strength generated by five times the number of unit X and ten times the number of unit Y should be at least 50000.\n- The sum from three times the quantity for unit X and four times that for unit Y should not exceed 30000.\n- The difference in numbers between unit X and unit Y should be no less than 1000.\n\nGiven these conditions, determine the minimum amount of support points needed while ensuring that the quantities for both units X and Y are whole numbers within their respective bounds.

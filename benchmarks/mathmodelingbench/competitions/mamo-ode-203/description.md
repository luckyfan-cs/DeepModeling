# Mamo Ode 203 A Spring Mass System Consists Of A Spring Stretched 2 Ft By A 4

A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched 2 ft by a 4.938-lb weight, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \(6.509 \mathrm{lb}-\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{ft}\). If the mass is released from -0.614 ft below the equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of \(3.957 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}\), formulate the problem to determine the mass's position over time. Calculate the mass's position at \(t = 4\) seconds, considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the position in feet, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

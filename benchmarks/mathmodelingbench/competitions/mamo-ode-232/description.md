# Mamo Ode 232 In This Scenario We Have A Block Of Copper With Thermal Conductivit

In this scenario, we have a block of copper with thermal conductivity k = 385 W/mK, density ρ=8900 kg/m³, and specific heat capacity C_p =385 J/kgK. The block has dimensions 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m and is initially at a temperature of 200 K, while the ambient temperature is 300 K. Using these parameters, we calculate the thermal resistance R and thermal capacitance C.  Evaluate the temperature in K at t=100 seconds. Keep four significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

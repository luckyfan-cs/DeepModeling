# Mamo Easy 333 An Energy Company Is Planning To Generate Electricity From Four Di

An energy company is planning to generate electricity from four different sources: coal, gas, wind and solar. Each unit of electricity generated by these sources costs \$0.8, \$1.2, \$1 and \$1.5 respectively.\n\nThe company has the following constraints for their daily generation schedule:- The combined units of electricity from coal and gas should be at least 500.- The combined units of electricity from wind and solar should be at least 200.- Due to equipment limitations, they can only generate a maximum of 700 units from coal, 600 units from gas, 300 units from wind and 250 units from solar per day.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of units due to technical practicalities, the question is:What is the minimum total cost for the company to meet its daily requirement given these constraints? Provide the answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole number.

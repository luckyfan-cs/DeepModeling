# Mamo Ode 178 In A Series Circuit With An Inductor Resistor And Capacitor Initial

In a series circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor initially open, a capacitor holds a charge of \(2\) coulombs, and a current of \(3\) amperes flows at the instant the circuit is closed. An external voltage of \(E(t)=20 \cos t\) is applied. The voltage drop across the resistor equals 4 times the rate of change of charge, across the capacitor equals 10 times the charge, and across the inductor equals 2 times the rate of change in current. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \(t=10\) seconds. Assume the direction of current flow from the positive to the negative terminal as positive. Provide your answers in coulombs for the charge, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 190 A Manufacturing Manager Is Planning The Production Of Three Types 

A manufacturing manager is planning the production of three types of products: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total production cannot exceed 1000 units due to capacity constraints. To fulfill customer demand, at least 500 units must be produced between product X (counted as double due to its complexity) and product Y. Additionally, a minimum of 400 units should be produced between product X and Z to maintain a balanced inventory. Each unit of product X, Y, and Z incurs costs of 2 ,3 ,and 4 respectively, which the manager aims to minimize while meeting all production constraints(X,Y,Z are integers). Find the minimum total cost in dollars.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

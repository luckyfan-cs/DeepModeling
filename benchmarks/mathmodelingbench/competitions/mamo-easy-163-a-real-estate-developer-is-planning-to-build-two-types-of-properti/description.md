# Mamo Easy 163 A Real Estate Developer Is Planning To Build Two Types Of Properti

A real estate developer is planning to build two types of properties: $X$ and $Y$. Each type of property has a different cost associated with it, with type $X$ costing $\$50,000$ per unit and type $Y$ costing $\$80,000$ per unit. The total number of properties that can be built is limited to 10 due to zoning regulations. To diversify the portfolio, the number of type X properties must be at least half the number of type Y properties plus an additional three units. Additionally, due to size limitations on the land parcel, no more than 7 units of property X and no more than 6 units of property Y can be built.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the number of units for both X and Y are integers as partial building units are not feasible in this context.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible total cost (in dollars) for building these properties? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

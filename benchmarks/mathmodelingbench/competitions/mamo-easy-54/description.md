# Mamo Easy 54 A Retail Store Manager Is Planning The Restocking Of Two Categories

A retail store manager is planning the restocking of two categories of products: $X$ and $Y$. The store needs to ensure a minimum level of inventory to meet customer demand, expressed as an inventory score calculated as $x + 3y \geq 10$. At the same time, due to storage limitations, the combined quantity of both categories should not exceed a maximum limit, given by the constraint $2x + y \leq 15$. Each unit of category $X$ and $Y$ costs \$4 and \$5 respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints(X,Y are integers). What is the minimum total cost in dollars for restocking these items under these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

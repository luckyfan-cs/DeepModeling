# Mamo Easy 466 In A Human Resources Scenario A Company Is Planning To Hire Employ

In a human resources scenario, a company is planning to hire employees for two different positions: position $X$ and position $Y$. The objective is to minimize the total salary cost associated with these positions, with salaries being $\$5000$ per employee for position $X$ and $\$3000$ per employee for position $Y$. \n\nDue to budget constraints, the total number of hires cannot exceed 50.

Provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.

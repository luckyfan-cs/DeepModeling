# Mamo Easy 292 An Educational Institution Is Planning To Allocate Resources Acros

An educational institution is planning to allocate resources across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent different initiatives such as improving infrastructure, enhancing faculty training, and developing new curricula respectively. The total resource allocation across all three projects cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. Project $X$ should have at least 10 more units allocated than twice the allocation for project $Y$ while the combined allocation for projects $Y$ and $Z$ must not exceed 70 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs costs of 3 , 2 , and 5 units respectively. The institution aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources. Each project also has specific bounds on resource allocation: Project X can receive between 0 and 50 units, Project Y between 0 and 30 units, and there's no upper limit specified for Project Z but it cannot receive negative resources.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 642 An Environmental Agency Is Planning To Allocate Resources To Four 

An environmental agency is planning to allocate resources to four different projects: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$. These projects could involve cleaning rivers, restoring forests, reducing air pollution, and raising public awareness about environmental issues respectively. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 4, 3, 5, and 6 units for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$, and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and project requirements:\n- The combined resource allocation for projects $x1$ and $x2$ cannot exceed 1000 units.\n- The combined resource allocation for twice the amount of project $x1$ and thrice the amount of project $x3$ should be at least 2000 units.\n- The difference in resource allocation between project $x2$ and half of project $X4$ must not exceed 500 units.\n- The difference in resource allocation between projects $X1$ ,and the sum of allocations for projects X2 and X3 should not exceed 70 units. \n\nConsidering each project has a specific bound on resource allocation due to its nature or other external factors; it's also important that all allocations are whole numbers because they represent complete units of resources. What would be the minimum total cost (in unit terms) required by this environmental agency if they optimally allocate their resources within specified bounds(X1, X2, X3, X4 are restricted to have maximum 300, 500, 2000, 30, respectively )? Provide your answer rounded to three decimal places.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

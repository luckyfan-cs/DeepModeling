# Mamo Easy 89 In A Scheduling Problem A Manager Needs To Allocate Time Between Tw

In a scheduling problem, a manager needs to allocate time between two tasks: $X$ and $Y$. Each task requires integer hours of work due to the nature of the tasks. The combined total hours for both tasks should be at least 10 hours to meet the minimum workload requirements. However, due to resource limitations, the weighted sum of twice the hours allocated to task $X$ and thrice the hours allocated to task $Y$ cannot exceed 24.\n\nEach hour dedicated to tasks $X$ and $Y$ incurs different costs, quantified as 8 and 5 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize these costs while meeting all constraints. Calculate the minimum total cost required for this scheduling scenario, rounded to nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

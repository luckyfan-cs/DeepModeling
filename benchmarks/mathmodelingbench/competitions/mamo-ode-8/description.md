# Mamo Ode 8 A Tank Initially Contains 1000 L Of Brine Which Has 15 Kg Of Dissolve

A tank initially contains \(1000\) L of brine, which has \(15\) kg of dissolved salt. Pure water flows into the tank at \(10\) L/min, and the well-mixed solution exits the tank at the same rate. Determine the amount of salt in kg remaining in the tank after \(20\) minutes, ensuring the solution is presented with three significant figures.

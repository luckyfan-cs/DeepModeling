# Mamo Easy 460 In A Scheduling Scenario A Manager Needs To Allocate Hours Between

In a scheduling scenario, a manager needs to allocate hours between two tasks: Task $X$ and Task $Y$. The total number of hours that can be allocated is limited to 40 due to time constraints. To meet the project's deadlines, the combined effort of twice the hours for Task $X$ and the hours for Task $Y$ must be at least 20. Moreover, the difference in hours between Task $X$ and Task $Y$ should not exceed 10 to ensure both tasks are progressing at similar rates. Each hour allocated to Tasks $X$ and $Y$ incurs different costs, quantified as 8 units for task X and 10 units for task Y respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to practicalities of scheduling. Additionally, there are specific upper bounds on how many hours can be allocated to each task with a maximum of 25 hours for task X and 15 hours for task Y.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required under these conditions rounded to nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

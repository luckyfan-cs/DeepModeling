# Mamo Complex 64 Imagine A Scenario Where A Sales Representative Needs To Travel 

Imagine a scenario where a sales representative needs to travel to six distinct cities to promote their company's products. The cities, identified as City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4, City 5, and City 6, are all part of the salesperson's designated territory. The objective is for the salesperson to visit each city exactly once, starting and ending at any one of the cities, while minimizing the total travel cost incurred during the trip. The costs associated with traveling between the cities are as follows:
- From City 1, the travel costs are 65 units to City 2, 41 units to City 3, 14 units to City 4, 16 units to City 5, and 35 units to City 6.
- From City 2, the costs are 65 units to City 1, 76 units to City 3, 52 units to City 4, 89 units to City 5, and 45 units to City 6.
- From City 3, the travel costs are 41 units to City 1, 76 units to City 2, 72 units to City 4, 38 units to City 5, and 62 units to City 6.
- From City 4, the costs to travel are 14 units to City 1, 52 units to City 2, 72 units to City 3, 22 units to City 5, and 24 units to City 6.
- From City 5, the costs are 16 units to City 1, 89 units to City 2, 38 units to City 3, 22 units to City 4, and 89 units to City 6.
- Lastly, from City 6, the travel costs are 35 units to City 1, 45 units to City 2, 62 units to City 3, 24 units to City 4, and 89 units to City 5.

Given these costs, what is the minimum total travel cost for the salesperson to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city?

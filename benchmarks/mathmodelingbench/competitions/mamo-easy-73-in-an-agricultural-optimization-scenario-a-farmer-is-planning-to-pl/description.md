# Mamo Easy 73 In An Agricultural Optimization Scenario A Farmer Is Planning To Pl

In an agricultural optimization scenario, a farmer is planning to plant two types of crops: crop $X$ and crop $Y$. The planting must adhere to the following constraints due to land, irrigation, and manpower limitations:  - The combined acreage for twice the area of crop $X$ and thrice the area of crop $Y$ cannot exceed 50 acres.- The acreage for crop $X$ must be at least 10 acres more than that of crop $Y$.Each acre of land planted with crops X and Y incurs costs such as seeds, fertilizers, labor etc., quantified as $\$100$ for crop X and $\$200$ for crop Y. The farmer aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (considering only whole numbers of acres due to practicalities). What is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this farming plan, rounded to the nearest dollar?

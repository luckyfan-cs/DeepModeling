# Mamo Easy 189 A Manufacturing Company Produces Three Types Of Products X Y And Z

A manufacturing company produces three types of products: X, Y, and Z. The costs to produce one unit of each product are $\$10$, $\$15$, and $\$20$ respectively. Due to resource constraints, the combined production of X and Y cannot exceed 5000 units, while the combined production of Y and Z cannot exceed 4000 units. To meet market demand, the combined production of X and Z must be at least 2000 units.\n\nGiven these constraints, what is the minimum total cost for producing these products if all productions are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

# Mamo Ode 158 Given A Spring System With A Mass Of 1 Kg And A Spring Constant Of 

Given a spring system with a mass of $1$ kg and a spring constant of $k = 100$, where the spring is initially released from a point $0.1$ m above its equilibrium position. For a damping constant of $c = 10$, calculate the position of the mass relative to the equilibrium position at a time $t = 0.2$ seconds, with the direction away from the spring's fixed point defined as positive. Determine the displacement and express the answer in meters to two significant figures.

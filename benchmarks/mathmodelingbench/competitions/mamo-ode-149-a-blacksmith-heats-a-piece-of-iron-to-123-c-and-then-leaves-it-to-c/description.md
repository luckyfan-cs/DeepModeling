# Mamo Ode 149 A Blacksmith Heats A Piece Of Iron To 123 C And Then Leaves It To C

A blacksmith heats a piece of iron to 123°C and then leaves it to cool in an environment that is kept at a constant temperature of 42°C. The cooling process follows Newton's Law of Cooling, with a rate constant \(k\) of \(0.1 \, \text{min}^{-1}\). Calculate the temperature of the iron after 12 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and in three significant figures.

# Mamo Easy 296 A School Is Planning To Hire Teachers Assistants And Staff For The

A school is planning to hire teachers, assistants, and staff for the upcoming academic year. The minimum requirement is 5 teachers, 3 assistants, and 2 staff members. However, due to budget constraints, the total number of hires across all categories cannot exceed 15. The cost associated with each hire differs by role: a teacher costs 20 units, an assistant costs 10 units, and a staff member costs 5 units. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of hires due to practical considerations (as it is not possible to hire fractions of individuals), what is the minimum total cost for hiring the necessary personnel while meeting all requirements? Provide your answer in unit cost rounded to the nearest whole number.

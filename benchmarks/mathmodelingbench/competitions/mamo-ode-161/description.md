# Mamo Ode 161 In A Series Circuit Featuring A Resistor Of R 24 Omega An Inductor 

In a series circuit featuring a resistor of $R=24 \Omega$, an inductor of $L=2 \mathrm{H}$, a capacitor of $C=0.005 \mathrm{F}$, and powered by a $12-\mathrm{V}$ battery, with an initial charge on the capacitor of $Q=0.001 \mathrm{C}$ and an initial current of 0, determine the current through the circuit at time $t=0.05$ seconds. The function that describes the current's time evolution in this circuit setting is based on the circuit's electrical properties. Calculate the current's value in Amperes, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

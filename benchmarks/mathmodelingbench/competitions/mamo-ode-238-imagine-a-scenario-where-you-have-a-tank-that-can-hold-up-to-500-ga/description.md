# Mamo Ode 238 Imagine A Scenario Where You Have A Tank That Can Hold Up To 500 Ga

Imagine a scenario where you have a tank that can hold up to 500 gallons of liquid. Initially, this tank is partially filled with 200 gallons of water, and within this water, there's 100 pounds of salt dissolved. Now, you start adding more water to this tank. However, this isn't just any water; it's water that has a high salt content, specifically 1 pound of salt per gallon. This saltwater is being poured into the tank at a consistent pace of 3 gallons per minute. At the same time, to prevent the tank from filling up too quickly and to ensure the mixture inside remains well-mixed, some of the liquid in the tank is allowed to flow out at a slightly slower rate of 2 gallons per minute.This concentration is a crucial figure because it will also be compared to what the concentration would theoretically be if the tank could expand infinitely, never reaching a point of overflow. What will be the concentration of salt in the tank, in pounds per gallon, at the brink of overflowing? Keep three siginificant digit in answer

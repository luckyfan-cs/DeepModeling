# Mamo Ode 302 Find The Charge On The Capacitor In An Lrc Series Circuit When L 0

Find the charge on the capacitor in an LRC-series circuit when L = 0.5 h, R = 10 V, C = 0.01 f, E(t) = 150 V, q(0) = 1 C, and i(0) = 0 A. What is the charge in coulomb on the capacitor after a long time? Keep two significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

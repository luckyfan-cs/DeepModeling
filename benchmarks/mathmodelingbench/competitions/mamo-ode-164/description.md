# Mamo Ode 164 Given A Spring System Where A 16 Lb Weight Is Attached To The Lower

Given a spring system where a 16-lb weight is attached to the lower end of a coil spring suspended from the ceiling, with the spring having a constant of 1 lb/ft, and the system's resistance equal to 15 times the instantaneous velocity. If at time t=0, the weight is released from 2 ft below its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 2 ft/s, model this physical situation with an initial value problem and solve for the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=0.5 seconds. Considering downward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction. Provide the answer in ft, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

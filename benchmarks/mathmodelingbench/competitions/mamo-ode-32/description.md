# Mamo Ode 32 A Water Tank Initially Contains 2901 L Of Water With A Solute Concen

A water tank initially contains \(2901\) L of water with a solute concentration of \(39\) mg/L. Water with a solute concentration of \(0.34\) mg/L is introduced into the tank at a rate of \(9\) L/min, and the well-mixed solution exits the tank at the same rate to maintain its volume. Determine the amount of solute in grams remaining in the tank after \(65\) minutes, ensuring that your answer is presented with five significant figures.

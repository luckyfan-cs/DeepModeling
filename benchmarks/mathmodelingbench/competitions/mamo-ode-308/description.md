# Mamo Ode 308 A Two Tank System Engaged In Fluid Exchange Each Labeled As Tank A 

A two-tank system engaged in fluid exchange, each labeled as Tank A and Tank B, with specific flow rates in and out of each tank. Tank A is being supplied with pure water at a consistent flow rate of 2 gallons per minute. Concurrently, it is receiving a mixed fluid from Tank B at a flow rate of 1 gallon per minute. Meanwhile, Tank A's outflow consists of this mixed fluid exiting at a rate of 1 gallon per minute. Over in Tank B, there is an incoming mixed fluid from Tank A at 2 gallons per minute. Additionally, Tank B is receiving another influx of a different mixture, characterized by a concentration of 1/2 pound of a certain solute per gallon, at a rate of 2 gallons per minute. Tank B's outflow discharges the mixed fluid at a higher rate of 3 gallons per minute.  Suppose that both tanks A and B initially contain 100 gallons of brine. The mixture pumped between and out of the tanks is assumed to be well-stirred. Construct a mathematical model in the form of a linear system of first-order differential equations for the number of pounds x1(t) and x2(t) of salt in tanks A and B, respectively, at time t, with x1(0) = 60, x2(0) = 10. What's the x1(t) in pounds when time to be infinite. Keep three significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Ode 209 Consider A Spring Mass Damper System Where An Object Of Mass 6

Consider a spring-mass-damper system where an object of mass 6.112 lbs is attached to a spring with a constant of 9.502 lb/ft, and the damper has a damping constant of 7.279 lb-sec/ft. At time t=0, the object is released from a position that is 2.467 ft above its equilibrium position (assuming upward direction as positive), and it's moving downward at an initial velocity of 6.692 ft/sec. What will be the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position at t=2 seconds? Provide your answer in feet, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 146 In A Military Operation A Commander Needs To Allocate Resources Be

In a military operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units: Tanks and Aircrafts. The total number of Tanks that can be deployed is limited to 20 due to logistical constraints, while the maximum number of Aircrafts that can be deployed is 15. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined strength must meet certain conditions. The combined strength calculated as three times the number of Tanks plus twice the number of Aircrafts should be at least 10. Additionally, another constraint states that four times the number of Tanks added to the number of Aircrafts should not exceed 30.\n\nEach unit of Tank requires 5 support points and each unit of Aircraft requires 7 support points respectively. The commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that both numbers are integers due to the indivisible nature of military units.\n\nWhat is the minimum total support points required for this operation? Please give your answer rounded to nearest whole number.

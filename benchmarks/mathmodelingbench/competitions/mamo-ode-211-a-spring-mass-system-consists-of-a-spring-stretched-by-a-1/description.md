# Mamo Ode 211 A Spring Mass System Consists Of A Spring Stretched By A 1

A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched by a 1.639 lb weight, with spring constant of 4.732 lb/ft, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \(7.001 \mathrm{lb}-\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{ft}\). If the mass is released from 0.163 ft above the equilibrium position with an initial upward velocity of \(6.055 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}\), formulate the problem to determine the mass's position over time. Calculate the mass's position at \(t = 7\) seconds, considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the position in feet, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

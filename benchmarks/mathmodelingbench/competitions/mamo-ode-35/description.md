# Mamo Ode 35 A Room With A Volume Of 8110 M 3 Initially Contains No Smoke

A room with a volume of \(8110\) m^3 initially contains no smoke. A machine is introduced into the room that generates smoke at a concentration of \(0.29\%\) and emits it into the room at a rate of \(2\) m^3/min. At the same time, air (with the mixed in smoke) is vented out of the room at a rate of \(2\) m^3/min to maintain constant volume. Calculate the percentage concentration of smoke in the room after \(12\) minutes. Provide your answer to one significant figures.

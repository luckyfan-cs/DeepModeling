# Mamo Easy 282 A Tourism Company Is Planning To Allocate Its Budget Across Three 

A tourism company is planning to allocate its budget across three major sectors: $X$ (advertising), $Y$ (transportation) and $Z$ (hospitality). The total budget across all three sectors cannot exceed $\$5000$. For effective reach, sector $X$ requires a minimum allocation of $\$1500$, while sector $Y$ requires at least $\$800$, and sector $Z$, being the face of the company's service, requires a minimum of $\$700$. Each dollar invested in sectors X, Y, and Z yields returns or costs quantified as 100, 200, and 50 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints (with investments made in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of monetary resources). What is the minimum total cost that this tourism company needs to spend for an optimal allocation rounded to nearest dollar?

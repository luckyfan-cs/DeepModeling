# Mamo Easy 334 An Energy Company Needs To Allocate Resources Across Four Projects

An energy company needs to allocate resources across four projects: X, Y, Z, and W. These projects could represent investments in different energy sources or technologies. The total investment across project X and Y cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints, while the combined investment for project Z and W is capped at 2000 units. Project X requires a minimum net investment of 1000 units more than project Z, while project Y should have a net surplus of at least 1500 units compared to project W. Additionally, each project has its own bounds on resource allocation: Project X's investment should not exceed 4000 units; Project Y's limit is set at 3000 units; Project Z needs a minimum funding of 500 units; and for Project W it is established at a floor value of 200 units.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects X, Y, Z, and W yields different returns or costs, quantified as \$20 , \$30 , \$50 , and \$10 per unit respectively. Given these conditions with the requirement that all investments are integers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated,\n\nWhat would be the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Please give your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

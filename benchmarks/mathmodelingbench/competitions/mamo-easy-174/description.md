# Mamo Easy 174 A Marketing Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of A Budget Across 

A marketing manager is planning the allocation of a budget across three campaigns: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total budget allocated cannot exceed 5000 units due to financial constraints. Additionally, there are certain reach objectives that must be met with this budget allocation. These objectives are calculated as follows: 5 times the budget for campaign X minus 3 times the budget for campaign Y plus the budget for campaign Z should be at least 2000 points. There's also a limit on how much more can be spent on campaign Y relative to the others: The combined spending on campaigns X and Z cannot exceed twice the spending on campaign Y by more than 1000 units.\n\nGiven that the cost per unit of effectiveness (reach point) for campaigns $X, Y$, and $Z$ are 100 , 50 , and 20 units respectively, and aiming to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints (with all budgets being whole numbers due to accounting practices), what is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this scenario? Please round your answer to nearest whole number.

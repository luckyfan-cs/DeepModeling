# Mamo Easy 168 A Marketing Manager Is Planning To Allocate Budget Across Three Di

A marketing manager is planning to allocate budget across three different advertising channels: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total budget for all channels cannot exceed $\$1000$. Each channel requires a minimum amount of budget to be viable: channel $X$ requires at least $\$200$, channel $Y$ needs at least $\$150$, and channel $Z$ must have at least $\$100$. The cost per unit effectiveness for each channel is different, with channel X costing \$50 per unit, channel Y costing \$60 per unit, and channel Z costing \$70 per unit. If the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that the budgets for all channels are in whole numbers (due to the indivisible nature of the monetary units), what is the minimum possible total cost? Please give your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation

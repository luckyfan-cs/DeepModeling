Suppose glucose is infused into a patient's bloodstream at a constant rate of 5 grams per minute. At the same time, glucose is removed from the bloodstream at a rate proportional to the amount of glucose present, with a proportionality constant of 0.1 per minute. Find the value of G as t approaches infinity(in  grams). Keep 2 significant figures.

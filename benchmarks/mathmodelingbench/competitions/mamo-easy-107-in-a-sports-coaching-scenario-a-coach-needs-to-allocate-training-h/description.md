# Mamo Easy 107 In A Sports Coaching Scenario A Coach Needs To Allocate Training H

In a sports coaching scenario, a coach needs to allocate training hours between two types of workouts, $X$ and $Y$. The workouts could represent different types of training such as strength conditioning and skill development. Due to time constraints, the total training hours for both types combined cannot exceed 50 hours per week. To achieve specific fitness and skill objectives, the combined effort from these workouts must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as twice the number of hours spent on workout X plus the number of hour spent on workout Y, which should be at least 20 points.\n\nFurthermore, in order to maintain a balanced training schedule, the difference in hours between workout X and three times that of workout Y should not exceed 10. Given that each hour spent on type $X$ costs 5 fatigue points while type $Y$ costs 3 fatigue points (which represents physical stress or risk of injury), if we want to minimize total fatigue while meeting all constraints (considering only whole numbers for training hours due to practicality), what is the minimum total fatigue cost? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole point.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 546 A Supply Chain Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Resources Acr

A supply chain manager is planning the allocation of resources across three main aspects: raw materials procurement, labor deployment, and transportation. The cost per unit of each resource is 4 for raw materials, 3 for labor, and 2 for transportation. To ensure optimal operations:\n\n- The combined total of raw materials procured and labor deployed must be at least 50 units.\n- The difference between the number of labor units and the number of transportation units should not exceed 10.\n- The excess of raw material procurement over labor deployment should exactly equal to 20 units.\n- Lastly, the combined total of raw materials procured and transportation cannot exceed 100 units due to storage limitations.\n\nGiven these constraints (which require allocations to be whole numbers), what is the minimum total cost that can be achieved with an optimal allocation plan? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

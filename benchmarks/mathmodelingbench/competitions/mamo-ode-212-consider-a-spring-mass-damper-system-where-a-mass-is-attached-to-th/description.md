# Mamo Ode 212 Consider A Spring Mass Damper System Where A Mass Is Attached To Th

Consider a spring-mass-damper system where a mass is attached to the lower end of a coil spring suspended from the ceiling. The spring constant is such that 1 ft of extension corresponds to 32 lb of force, and the damping constant is proportional to velocity with proportionality constant equal to one. If at time t=0, the mass is released from 1 ft below its equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of 1 ft/s and subjected to an external force \(f(t) = \sec^2 x\) (in pounds). Calculate the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=1 seconds. Considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive direction. Provide your answer in feet, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

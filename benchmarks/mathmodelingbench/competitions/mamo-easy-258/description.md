# Mamo Easy 258 In A Supply Chain Management Scenario A Company Needs To Allocate 

In a supply chain management scenario, a company needs to allocate resources across three key operations: purchasing ($X$), manufacturing ($Y$), and distribution ($Z$). These operations could represent investments in raw materials, labor, and transportation respectively. The total investment across all three operations cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. In addition, the combined effectiveness of these operations (calculated as 3 times the investment in purchasing plus 2 times the investment in manufacturing plus the investment in distribution) must be at least 800 units to meet demand requirements.\n\nThe difference between investments in purchasing and manufacturing should not exceed 300 units to maintain operational balance. Each unit of investment in purchasing, manufacturing, and distribution incurs costs of 2, 3, and 1 units respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these operational constraints.\n\nGiven that all investments are integer values due to their indivisible nature and specific bounds on each operation's resource allocation:\nWhat is the minimum total cost for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.

### Submission Format

# Mamo Easy 122 An Educational Institute Is Planning To Distribute A Budget Betwee

An educational institute is planning to distribute a budget between two programs, $X$ and $Y$. The total budget for both programs combined is constrained to a maximum of 40 units. The minimum allocation for program $X$ is 15 units and for program $Y$, it is 10 units. Also, the maximum possible allocation for program $X$ cannot exceed 30 units due to logistical constraints, similarly, for program $Y$, it cannot exceed 20 units. The cost per unit of effectiveness (which the institution aims to minimize) for program $X$ is 10 units and for program $Y$ it's 5 units. The distribution needs to be done in whole numbers due to the nature of resources involved. Find the minimum total cost if we are distributing resources optimally between both programs, rounded off to nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

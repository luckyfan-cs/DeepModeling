# Mamo Easy 103 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of New Hires 

A Human Resources manager is planning the allocation of new hires between two departments, $X$ and $Y$. To ensure adequate staffing, the total number of new hires across both departments must be at least 10. However, due to budget constraints and office space limitations, the combined staffing level for twice as many in department $X$ and department $Y$ should not exceed 20. Given that each new hire in department $X$ requires an onboarding cost of $\$50$, while in department $Y$ it costs $\$30$, and the HR manager aims to minimize the total onboarding cost. If only whole numbers of staff are considered because people cannot be fractionally hired, what is the minimum total onboarding cost? Please give your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

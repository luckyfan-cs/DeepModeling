# Mamo Easy 115 A Tourism Department Is Planning To Allocate Its Budget Between Tw

A tourism department is planning to allocate its budget between two advertising campaigns, $X$ and $Y$. The total budget allocated for both campaigns cannot exceed $\$100$. In order to reach a wide audience, the combined effort of these campaigns must yield a minimum effectiveness score. This score is calculated as twice the budget for campaign $X$ plus thrice the budget for campaign $Y$, and it must be at least 150 points. Each unit of effectiveness costs $\$20$ in campaign $X$ and $\$30$ in campaign $Y$. If the department aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (considering that budgets are allocated in whole dollars due to accounting rules), what would be the minimum total cost in dollars? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.

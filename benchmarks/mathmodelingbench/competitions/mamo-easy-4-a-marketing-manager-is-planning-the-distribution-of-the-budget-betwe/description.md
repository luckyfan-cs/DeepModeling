# Mamo Easy 4 A Marketing Manager Is Planning The Distribution Of The Budget Betwe

A marketing manager is planning the distribution of the budget between two advertising channels for an upcoming campaign. The total budget for both channels combined is constrained to a maximum of \$5000. Additionally, to meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, the combined effort of these channels must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as 3 times the budget for channel X plus 4 times the budget for channel Y, of at least 12000 points. At the same time, to maintain balance in campaign design, 5 times the budget allocated to channel X minus twice that allocated to channel Y should not exceed 10000 points. Given that cost per unit of effectiveness for channel $X$ is \$200 and for channel $Y$ is \$150$, and given that budgets can only be distributed in whole dollars due to accounting regulations, find out what is minimum total cost while meeting all constraints.

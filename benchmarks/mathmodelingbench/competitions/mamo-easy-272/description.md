# Mamo Easy 272 In A Sports Tournament A Coach Is Planning The Allocation Of Playe

In a sports tournament, a coach is planning the allocation of players between three teams: X, Y, and Z. The total number of players that can be allocated is limited to 50 due to logistical constraints. To ensure a balanced team structure, the combined number of players in team Y and team Z must be at least 30. Additionally, the combined number of players in team X and team Z should not exceed 40 to maintain balance among the teams.\n\nThe performance score associated with each player for teams X, Y and Z are given as 3 points, 4 points and 2 points respectively. These scores represent their contributions to their respective teams' performances. Given these conditions and considering that only whole numbers of players can be assigned to each team (since partial assignment of a player is not possible), what is the minimum total performance score achievable for this sports tournament? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

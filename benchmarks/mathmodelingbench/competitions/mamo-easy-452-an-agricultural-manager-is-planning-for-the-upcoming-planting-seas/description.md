# Mamo Easy 452 An Agricultural Manager Is Planning For The Upcoming Planting Seas

An agricultural manager is planning for the upcoming planting season. They have two main resources to allocate: fertilizer and seeds, which cost \$5 and \$10 per unit respectively. The total units of both resources combined must equal 500 due to storage constraints. Also, the allocation should satisfy the following conditions:\n\n- The combined units of twice the fertilizer and thrice the seeds cannot exceed 1000.\n- The difference between four times the fertilizer units and seed units must be at least 200.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting all these conditions. Given that all allocations are in whole numbers due to practical limitations, what is the minimum possible total cost (in dollars) for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

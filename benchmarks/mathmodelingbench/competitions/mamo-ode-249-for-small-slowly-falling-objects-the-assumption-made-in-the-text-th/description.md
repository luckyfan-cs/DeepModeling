# Mamo Ode 249 For Small Slowly Falling Objects The Assumption Made In The Text Th

For small, slowly falling objects, the assumption made in the text that the drag force is proportional to the velocity is a good one. For larger, more rapidly falling objects, it is more accurate to assume that the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity.  If m = 10 kg, the drag coefficient is 10g/2401 kg/m. Determine the limiting velocity in m/s after a long time. Keep three significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

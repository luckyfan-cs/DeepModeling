# Mamo Easy 511 A Manufacturing Company Is Planning To Optimize Its Production By 

A manufacturing company is planning to optimize its production by allocating resources among raw materials, labour, and machines. The costs associated with each unit of resource are \$20 for raw materials, \$30 for labour, and \$10 for machines. Given that all allocations should be in whole numbers due to the nature of the resources:\n\n- The total allocation for raw materials and labour must be at least 1000 units to meet the minimum production requirements.\n- The difference between the allocation for labour and machines cannot exceed 500 units to maintain a balanced workflow.\n- The allocation for raw materials minus twice the allocation for machines should be at least 400 units due to specific project requirements.\n\nIn addition, there are specific bounds on resource allocations: Raw Materials (0 - 2000 units), Labour (0 - 1500 units), Machines (0 - 700 units).\n\nGiven these constraints, what is the minimum total cost in dollars required for this operation, rounded to the nearest dollar?

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

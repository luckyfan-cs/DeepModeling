# Mamo Ode 147 A Blacksmith Is Heating An Iron Rod At A Temperature Of 177 C In A 

A blacksmith is heating an iron rod at a temperature of 177°C in a furnace. The rod is then taken out and left to cool in the environment with a constant ambient temperature of 36°C. According to Newton's Law of Cooling, the rate constant \(k\) for the cooling process is found to be \(0.127 \, \text{min}^{-1}\). Determine the temperature of the iron rod after 20 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and rounded off to two decimal places.

# Mamo Easy 481 In An Educational Setting A School Needs To Allocate Resources Bet

In an educational setting, a school needs to allocate resources between two initiatives: $X$ (e.g., STEM program) and $Y$ (e.g., arts program). The total resources for both initiatives combined cannot exceed 500 units due to budget constraints. Initiative $X$ should receive at least 100 more units than initiative $Y$ to ensure adequate funding for lab equipment or other specialized requirements. However, the allocation for initiative $X$ should not surpass 350 units to maintain balance in resource distribution across various programs.\n\nThe cost per unit of resource is different for each initiative: it is 20 units for initiative $X$, and 10 units for initiative $Y$. The school aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the allocations are in whole numbers as they represent indivisible items like textbooks or computers.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required under these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Ode 95 In An Ecosystem A Species With An Initial Population Of 200 Individu

In an ecosystem, a species with an initial population of 200 individuals exhibits seasonal changes in its growth rate, modeled by a cosine function reflecting variations in food availability. Given a maximum growth rate of 0.05 per month, a seasonal cycle frequency of \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) per month, and a phase shift of \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians, calculate the population after 6 months. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

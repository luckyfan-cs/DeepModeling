# Mamo Easy 132 An Environmental Conservation Organization Is Planning To Allocate

An environmental conservation organization is planning to allocate resources between two projects: Project X and Project Y. These projects could involve restoring habitats, promoting sustainable practices, conducting research, or raising awareness about environmental issues. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these projects, with costs being 4 units for each resource allocated to project X and 5 units for each resource allocated to project Y.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations and strategic objectives:\n- The combined resource allocation for project X and twice the allocation for project Y cannot exceed 100 units.\n- The allocation for three times project X minus project Y must be at least 50 units, reflecting specific project requirements or strategic priorities.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that the allocations for both projects must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources,\nWhat is the minimum total cost in units for this scenario given an optimal allocation of resources between Project X and Project Y? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

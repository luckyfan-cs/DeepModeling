# Mamo Ode 171 An Lrc Circuit Includes An Inductance Of 1 5 Henry A Resistance Of 

An LRC circuit includes an inductance of \(1 / 5\) henry, a resistance of \(1 \mathrm{ohm}\), and a capacitance of \(5/6\) farad, with an initial charge of 2 coulombs on the capacitor and an initial current of 4 amperes. Develop a function to describe the charge on the capacitor over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \(t = 0.2\) seconds, assuming the direction of increasing charge as positive. Express your answer in coulombs, rounded to five significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

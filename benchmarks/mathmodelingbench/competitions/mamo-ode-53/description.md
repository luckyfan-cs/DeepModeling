# Mamo Ode 53 A Parachutist With A Combined Weight Of 161 Lb Falls From Rest Towar

A parachutist with a combined weight of 161 lb falls from rest towards Earth. Initially, the air resistance is proportional to the velocity (\(V/2\)). After 5 seconds, the parachute opens, changing the air resistance to be proportional to the square of the velocity (\(V^2/2\)). Calculate the velocity \(V(t)\) of the parachutist 10 seconds after the fall begins, which is 5 seconds after the parachute opens. Provide the answer in feet per second (ft/s) to five significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

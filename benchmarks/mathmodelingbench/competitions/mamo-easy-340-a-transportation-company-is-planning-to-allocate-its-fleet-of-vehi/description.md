# Mamo Easy 340 A Transportation Company Is Planning To Allocate Its Fleet Of Vehi

A transportation company is planning to allocate its fleet of vehicles to four different routes: x1, x2, x3, and x4. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these routes, with costs being 2, 3, 4, and 5 units for each vehicle assigned to x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to logistical limitations and service requirements:- The combined number of vehicles on routes x1 and x2 cannot exceed 100.- The combined number of vehicles on routes x3 and x4 cannot exceed 200.- At least 50 vehicles must be allocated between routes x1 and x3.- At least 150 vehicles must be allocated between routes x2 and x4.\n\nGiven the constraints and the objective function along with the requirement that all allocations must be whole numbers (since a fractional vehicle assignment is not practical), What is the minimum total cost for operating this transportation system optimally while meeting all specified constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

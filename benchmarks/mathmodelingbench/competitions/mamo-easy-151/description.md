# Mamo Easy 151 A Shipping Company Is Trying To Optimize The Allocation Of Two Typ

A shipping company is trying to optimize the allocation of two types of cargo, $X$ and $Y$, to a ship with limited capacity. The total weight of both cargos combined cannot exceed 100 tons due to the ship's capacity limit. To meet certain business commitments, the combined value of these cargos, calculated as twice the weight for cargo $X$ plus three times the weight for cargo $Y$, must be at least 150 units.\n\nThe costs associated with each ton of cargo are $\$4$ for cargo $X$ and $\$5$ for cargo $Y$. The company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints and ensuring that both weights are integers because they can only accept whole tons of cargo.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars that this company needs to spend on transporting these cargos while adhering to all mentioned constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

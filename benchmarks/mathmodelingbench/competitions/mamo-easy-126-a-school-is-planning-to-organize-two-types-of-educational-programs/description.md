# Mamo Easy 126 A School Is Planning To Organize Two Types Of Educational Programs

A school is planning to organize two types of educational programs, X and Y. Each program will be conducted in whole numbers due to the nature of the sessions. The total number of both X and Y programs must not be less than 30 to ensure that a substantial portion of students benefit from these initiatives. Moreover, the difference between twice the number of X programs and Y should not exceed 10, maintaining balance between these two types of programs.\n\nThe cost associated with conducting each program is different: each X type program costs 4 units and each Y type program costs 3 units. The school aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost for organizing these educational programs, rounded off to the nearest whole number?

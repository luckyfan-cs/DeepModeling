# Mamo Ode 152 A Freshly Baked Loaf Of Bread At A Temperature Of 72 C Is Left To C

A freshly baked loaf of bread at a temperature of 72°C is left to cool in a room where the ambient temperature is constant at 35°C. The rate constant \(k\) for the cooling process, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is found to be \(0.196 \, \text{hr}^{-1}\). Calculate the temperature of the loaf after 12 hours. Provide your answer in °C and up to three decimal places.

# Mamo Ode 28 A Large Tank Initially Contains 4516 L Of Water With 87 Kg Of Sugar 

A large tank initially contains \(4516\) L of water with \(87\) kg of sugar dissolved in it. Fresh water, without any sugar, is pumped into the tank at a rate of \(8\) L/min. At the same time, the well-mixed solution is drained from the tank at an equal rate to maintain a constant volume. Sugar is also added to the tank at a constant rate of \(0.23\) kg/min. Determine how much sugar (in kg) will be in the tank after \(24\) hours? Give your answer to five significant figures.

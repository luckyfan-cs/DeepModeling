# Mamo Ode 204 A 9

A 9.026-kg object is suspended from a spring that stretches the spring by 1 m. The system is in a medium where the resistance to motion is proportional to velocity and equivalent to \(6.552 \, \text{N} / (\text{m/s})\). Initially, the object is displaced 4.884 m above its equilibrium position and released with an initial upward velocity of 4.443 m/s. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t = 3 seconds rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

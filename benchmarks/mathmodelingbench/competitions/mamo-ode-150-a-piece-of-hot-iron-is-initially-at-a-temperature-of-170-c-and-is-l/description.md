# Mamo Ode 150 A Piece Of Hot Iron Is Initially At A Temperature Of 170 C And Is L

A piece of hot iron is initially at a temperature of 170°C and is left to cool in a room with a constant ambient temperature of 22°C. The rate constant \(k\) for the cooling process, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is found to be \(0.005 \, \text{min}^{-1}\). Calculate the temperature of the iron after 14 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and up to three decimal places.

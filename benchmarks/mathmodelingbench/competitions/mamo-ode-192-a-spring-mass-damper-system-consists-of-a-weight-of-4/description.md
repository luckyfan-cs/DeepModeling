# Mamo Ode 192 A Spring Mass Damper System Consists Of A Weight Of 4

A spring-mass-damper system consists of a weight of 4.451 lbs attached to a spring with a stiffness constant of 2.064 lbs/ft. The system is immersed in a medium that creates damping proportional to the velocity, with a damping constant of 7.136 lb-sec/ft. At time t=0, the weight is pulled up 6.95 ft from its equilibrium position and released with an initial upward velocity of 6.048 ft/sec. Assuming upward as positive direction, calculate the displacement from its equilibrium position at t=5 seconds? Provide your answer in feet, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

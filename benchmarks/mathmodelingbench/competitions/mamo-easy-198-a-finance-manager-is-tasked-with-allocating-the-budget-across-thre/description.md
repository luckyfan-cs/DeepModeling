# Mamo Easy 198 A Finance Manager Is Tasked With Allocating The Budget Across Thre

A finance manager is tasked with allocating the budget across three different projects: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total budget allocated to all three projects cannot exceed $\$5000$. Project $X$ requires a minimum investment of $\$1000$ to be viable, while project $Y$ has a maximum allowable investment of $\$3000$ due to regulatory limitations. Project $Z$, on the other hand, requires a minimum investment of $\$500$. Each unit of investment in projects X, Y, and Z costs \$100, \$200, and \$50 respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Since budgets are allocated in whole dollars, determine the minimum possible total cost (in dollars) for this allocation strategy.

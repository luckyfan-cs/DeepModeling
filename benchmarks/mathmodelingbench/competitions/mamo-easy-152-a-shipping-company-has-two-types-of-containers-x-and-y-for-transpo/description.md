# Mamo Easy 152 A Shipping Company Has Two Types Of Containers X And Y For Transpo

A shipping company has two types of containers, $X$ and $Y$, for transporting goods. The cost to ship a container of type $X$ is $\$50$, and the cost to ship a container of type $Y$ is $\$70$. Due to capacity constraints on their ships, they can only transport a maximum of 1000 containers per trip. To meet certain contractual obligations, they must ship at least 300 containers of type $X$ and at least 200 containers of type $Y$. If the number of each container type shipped must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the containers, what is the minimum possible total cost for shipping these containers in one trip? Please provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest dollar.

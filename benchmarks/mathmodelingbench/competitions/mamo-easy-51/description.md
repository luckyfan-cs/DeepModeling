# Mamo Easy 51 A Retail Store Manager Is Planning To Stock Up Two Types Of Product

A retail store manager is planning to stock up two types of products: X and Y. The total number of items for both products combined cannot exceed 200 due to storage limitations. To meet customer demand, the combined units sold, calculated as 3 times the units of product X plus 2 times the units of product Y, must be at least 150. Each unit of product X and Y costs $5 and $10 respectively, and the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (considering that he can only buy whole numbers of each product due to their packaging). Calculate the minimum total cost in dollars for stocking up these products, rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

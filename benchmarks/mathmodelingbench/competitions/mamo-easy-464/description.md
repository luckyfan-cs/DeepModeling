# Mamo Easy 464 A Supply Chain Manager Is Trying To Optimize The Distribution Of G

A supply chain manager is trying to optimize the distribution of goods between two warehouses, X and Y. The total amount distributed should not exceed 1000 units due to transportation constraints. To meet demand, the combined number of units, with twice the count from warehouse X and thrice from warehouse Y, should be at least 1500. Furthermore, the difference in units between warehouse X and warehouse Y must not exceed 300 to ensure balanced stock levels.\n\nEach unit distributed from warehouse X costs $10 while it costs $15 for each unit from warehouse Y. Given that both warehouses can only deal with whole numbers of units due to packaging limitations and considering that there are specific bounds on how many units each warehouse can handle (warehouse X: maximum 700 units; warehouse Y: maximum 500 units), what is the minimum total cost for optimal distribution across these two warehouses? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

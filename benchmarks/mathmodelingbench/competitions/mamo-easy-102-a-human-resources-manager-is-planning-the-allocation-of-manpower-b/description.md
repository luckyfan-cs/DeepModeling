# Mamo Easy 102 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Manpower B

A Human Resources manager is planning the allocation of manpower between two projects: Project $X$ and Project $Y$. The total manpower that can be assigned to both projects combined cannot exceed 100 people due to budget constraints. Additionally, Project $X$ requires a minimum of 20 people, and Project $Y$ needs at least 10 people for successful execution. Each person allocated to Project $X$ and $Y$ incurs a cost of $\$50$ and $\$30$, respectively, and the HR manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints (the number of people for both X and Y must be integers). Calculate the minimum total cost required in dollars for this scenario, rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 13 An Energy Company Is Planning To Invest In Solar And Wind Energy Pr

An energy company is planning to invest in solar and wind energy projects. The cost of investing in the solar project per unit is $\$4$, while it's $\$5$ for the wind project. In order to achieve a balanced portfolio, the total power output from 3 units of solar energy and 2 units of wind energy should be at least 10 MW. Moreover, due to resource constraints, the difference between the power outputs from solar and wind should not exceed 5 MW. Given that the investments must be whole numbers because they represent complete units of projects (solar and wind), what is the minimum possible total investment cost for this scenario? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

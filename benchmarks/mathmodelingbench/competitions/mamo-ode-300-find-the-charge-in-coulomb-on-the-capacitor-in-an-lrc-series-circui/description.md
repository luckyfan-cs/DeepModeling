# Mamo Ode 300 Find The Charge In Coulomb On The Capacitor In An Lrc Series Circui

Find the charge in coulomb on the capacitor in an LRC-series circuit at t = pi/3 s when L = 5/3 h, R =10 ohm, C = 1/30 f, E(t) = 300 V, q(0) = 0 C, i(0) = 0 A. Keep four significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

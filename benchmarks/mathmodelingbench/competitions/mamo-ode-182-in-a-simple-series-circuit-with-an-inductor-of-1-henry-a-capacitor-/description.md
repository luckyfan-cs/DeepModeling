# Mamo Ode 182 In A Simple Series Circuit With An Inductor Of 1 Henry A Capacitor 

In a simple series circuit with an inductor of \(1\) henry, a capacitor of \(10^{-6}\) farads, and a resistor of \(1000 \mathrm{ohms}\), initially, the capacitor has no charge. A \(12\) volt battery is connected, and the circuit is closed at \(t=0\). Determine the charge on the capacitor \(1\) second after the circuit is closed, considering the direction of charge accumulation as positive. Calculate the charge in coulombs, rounded to two significant figures

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

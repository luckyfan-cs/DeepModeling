# Mamo Easy 64 A Telecommunications Company Is Planning To Allocate Resources Betw

A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between two projects, Project X and Project Y. The objective is to minimize the total cost while meeting certain performance requirements. The cost of allocating a unit of resource to Project X and Project Y are \$500 and \$700 respectively.\n\nThe company has set the following conditions for resource allocation:- The combined effort from both projects (calculated as 2 times the resources allocated to project X plus 3 times the resources allocated to project Y) must be at least 2000 units in order to meet performance targets.- The total resources allocated cannot exceed 1500 units due to budget constraints.\n\nGiven these conditions and considering that resource allocation should be in whole numbers due to practical considerations, what is the minimum total cost for the company, given optimal resource allocation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

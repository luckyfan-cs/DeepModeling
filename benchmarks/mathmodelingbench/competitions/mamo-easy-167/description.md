# Mamo Easy 167 A Marketing Manager Is Planning To Allocate The Budget Among Three

A marketing manager is planning to allocate the budget among three different campaigns: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total combined budget for all three campaigns cannot exceed $\$1000$. Campaign $X$ requires at least $\$100$ more than campaign $Y$, and campaign $Y$ requires at least $\$50$ more than campaign $Z$. Each dollar spent on campaigns $X, Y$, and $Z$ generates an estimated return of 10, 15, and 20 units respectively. Given these conditions and aiming for whole dollar amounts due to budgeting practicalities, what is the minimum amount of returns the marketing manager can expect from these campaigns? Please provide your answer in unit returns rounded to the nearest whole number.

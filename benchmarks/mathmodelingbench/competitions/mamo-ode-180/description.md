# Mamo Ode 180 Consider A Spring Mass System Consisting Of A 1 Kg Mass Attached To

Consider a spring-mass system consisting of a 1 kg mass attached to a spring with a spring constant of \(1 \mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}\), immersed in a viscous medium with a damping constant of \(2 \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{m}\). Initially, the mass is positioned \(1/4\) meter below its equilibrium position and given an upward velocity of \(1 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}\) at time \(t=0\). Determine the function that models the mass's movement over time. Calculate the mass's displacement from the equilibrium position at a given time \(t\), considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the displacement in meters at \(t = 2\) seconds, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

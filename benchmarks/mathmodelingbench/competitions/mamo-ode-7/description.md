# Mamo Ode 7 A Patient Receives An Intravenous Glucose Solution At A Constant Rate

A patient receives an intravenous glucose solution at a constant rate, and as glucose enters the bloodstream, it's simultaneously converted to other substances and removed at a rate proportional to its current concentration. Given an initial concentration of glucose in the bloodstream of \(2\) mg/L at time \(t=0\), a constant infusion rate \(r=5\) mg/L/min, and a conversion/removal rate constant \(k=0.1\) /min, calculate the glucose concentration in the bloodstream after \(10\) minutes. Provide the answer in mg/L to five significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 557 A Tourism Company Needs To Allocate Resources Across Three Differe

A tourism company needs to allocate resources across three different tour packages: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of tour packages that can be provided is limited to 500 due to logistical constraints. Package $X$ should not be less than half of the package $Y$, and the difference in numbers between package $Y$ and package $Z$ should not exceed 150, considering customer preferences. Additionally, the sum of packages $X$ and $Y$ should be at least 200 to meet minimum service requirements.\n\nEach tour package incurs a different cost, with costs being $\$50$, $\$30$, and $\$100$ for each unit of $X, Y,$ and $Z$, respectively. The company aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints. All allocations must be in whole numbers due to practical considerations.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario, rounded off to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 529 A Retail Store Manager Is Planning To Allocate Resources Among Thr

A retail store manager is planning to allocate resources among three departments: inventory (x1), advertising (x2), and customer service (x3). The total allocation across all three departments cannot exceed 2000 units due to budget constraints. To maintain a balanced operation, twice the allocation for inventory minus half of the allocation for advertising must be at least 500 units. Moreover, the difference between the allocation for customer service and 80% of the allocation for inventory should not exceed 1000 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to inventory, advertising, and customer service has different costs associated with it: 5 , 3 , and 7 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these operational constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of resources.\n\nAdditionally, each department has specific bounds on resource allocation: Inventory can receive no more than 1500 units; Advertising can take up to a maximum of 800 units; Customer Service can utilize up to but no more than 1200 units.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

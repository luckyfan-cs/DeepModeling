# Mamo Ode 189 A Spring Mass System Is Designed With A Weight That Naturally Stret

A spring-mass system is designed with a weight that naturally stretches the spring 1 meter. The system experiences resistance in a medium equivalent to 3.957 m/s. Starting from a point 0.614 meters below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at an initial speed, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=4 seconds. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, provide the displacement in meters, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

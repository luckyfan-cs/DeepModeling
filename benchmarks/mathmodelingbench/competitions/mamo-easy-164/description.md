# Mamo Easy 164 A Real Estate Developer Has Two Types Of Properties To Invest In C

A real estate developer has two types of properties to invest in: commercial buildings (X) and residential complexes (Y). The investment must be whole units due to the indivisible nature of properties. Each commercial building requires an investment of \$150,000 and each residential complex requires \$200,000. The developer's total budget allows for investments in up to 10 properties.\n\nTo maintain a diversified portfolio, the number of commercial buildings plus half the number of residential complexes should be at least 5. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of properties, what is the minimum total investment required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

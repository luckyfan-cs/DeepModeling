# Mamo Ode 196 A Spring System Is Constructed With A 3 Lb Weight That Naturally St

A spring system is constructed with a 3-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring by 2 inches. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is proportional to the velocity of the weight, equivalent to \(1.542 / \sqrt{g}\) lb times the velocity in feet per second. Starting from a point 0.337 ft below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 0.843 ft/sec, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=5 seconds. Considering upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, provide your answer in feet, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 67 A Farmer Has A Field That Can Accommodate Up To 1000 Acres Of Crops

A farmer has a field that can accommodate up to 1000 acres of crops. He decides to plant wheat and corn on this field. The combined area planted with wheat and corn should not exceed 1000 acres. In order to maintain soil fertility, the area planted with twice as much wheat plus four times the area planted with corn must be at least 800 acres. Moreover, planting three times as much wheat as corn can cause soil degradation, so the difference between thrice the area planted with wheat and the area planted with corn must not exceed 500 acres.\n\nThe cost per acre for growing wheat is \$4 and for growing corn is \$3. To minimize his costs while respecting these constraints (and bearing in mind that he cannot plant a fraction of an acre), what is the minimum amount in dollars that it would cost him?

# Mamo Ode 179 A Spring Mass System Consists Of A 1 Kg Mass Attached To A Spring W

A spring-mass system consists of a 1 kg mass attached to a spring with a spring constant of \(2 \mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}\) and is immersed in a viscous medium with a damping constant of \(3 \mathrm{N} \cdot \mathrm{s} / \mathrm{m}\). Initially, the mass is positioned \(1/2\) meter below its equilibrium position and released at time \(t=0\). Determine the movement of the mass at a given time \(t\), considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Calculate the position of the mass at \(t = 1\) second, and provide your answer in meters, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

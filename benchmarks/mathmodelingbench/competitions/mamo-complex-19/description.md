# Mamo Complex 19 Suppose You Are A Student On A Budget Trying To Balance The Need

Suppose you are a student on a budget, trying to balance the need for good nutrition with your financial constraints. You have identified four different food items that you could include in your meals: Eggs, Rice, Chicken, and Broccoli. Each of these items provides different amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and also has a different cost.

Here's a rundown of what each food item offers and its cost:

- Eggs: For a cost of $6, you get 4 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 238 calories.
- Rice: For $10, you can get 1 gram of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 85 calories.
- Chicken: A true bargain at only $1, it offers 10 grams of protein, 29 grams of carbohydrates, and 146 calories.
- Broccoli: Costs $7 and provides 8 grams of protein, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 139 calories.

Your daily dietary goal is to consume at least 93 grams of protein, 165 grams of carbohydrates, and 1553 calories. Your ultimate goal is to work out the least expensive way to meet all these nutritional targets with the four food options you have. What is the cheapest cost to meet your nutrition requirements?

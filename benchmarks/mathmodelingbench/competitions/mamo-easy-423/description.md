# Mamo Easy 423 A Manufacturing Company Produces Two Types Of Products Steel And A

A manufacturing company produces two types of products: Steel and Aluminum. The production capacity allows them to produce up to 5000 units in total, but due to market demands, the company must manufacture at least 1000 units of Steel and 2000 units of Aluminum. The cost per unit for producing Steel is $20, and for Aluminum it is $30. The objective is to minimize the total production cost while satisfying these constraints, with the number of units produced being whole numbers due to practical reasons.\n\nGiven these conditions, what would be the minimum total cost (in dollars) for this manufacturing scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 50 A Hospital Is Planning To Allocate Staff Resources Between Doctors 

A hospital is planning to allocate staff resources between doctors and nurses for an upcoming health campaign. The total number of staff members (doctors and nurses combined) needed for the campaign must be at least 20. Furthermore, due to the specific requirements of the health campaign, the difference between twice the number of doctors and the number of nurses cannot exceed 10.\n\nThe cost per day for a doctor is \$10 while it's \$5 for a nurse. Given that both numbers of doctors and nurses are integers, what is the minimum total cost per day in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

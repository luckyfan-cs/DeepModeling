# Mamo Ode 155 Consider A Spring System Where An 8 Kg Mass Is Attached To A Spring

Consider a spring system where an 8-kg mass is attached to a spring. This system is initially stretched 0.4 m beyond its natural length by a force of 32 N. Starting from the equilibrium position, the mass is released with an initial velocity of 1 m/s. Determine the mass's position relative to the spring's natural length after 3 seconds, assuming away from the spring's fixed point as the positive direction. Express the answer in meters to four significant figures.

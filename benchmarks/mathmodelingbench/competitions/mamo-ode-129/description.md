# Mamo Ode 129 Consider A Rectangular Tank With Length 5 Mathrm M And Width 2 Math

Consider a rectangular tank with length $5 \mathrm{m}$ and width $2 \mathrm{m}$. The tank is initially filled with water up to a height of $19 \mathrm{m}$. Water drains out of the tank through a square hole at the bottom with side length of $0.5 \mathrm{m}$. Using Torricelli's law, which states that the speed, v, of efflux of water from the hole is given by $\sqrt{2gh}$ where g is acceleration due to gravity ($9.81 \mathrm{ms^{-2}}$) and h is the height of water above the outlet. Find out how much the height has decreased after 4 seconds. Answer in meters and round off your answer to three decimal places.

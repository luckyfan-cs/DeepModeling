# Mamo Easy 21 A Manufacturing Company Produces Two Types Of Products X And Y

A manufacturing company produces two types of products, $X$ and $Y$. The production cost for each unit of product $X$ is $\$5000$, and for product $Y$, it's $\$3000$. The total units produced for both products combined cannot exceed 1000 due to capacity constraints. To meet the market demand, the combined units produced, calculated as 3 times the units of product X plus 2 times the units of product Y, must be at least 2000. Additionally, the difference between the units produced for product X and Y should be at least 150 to maintain a balanced portfolio.\n\nGiven that all variables are integers due to the indivisible nature of physical goods, what is the minimum total production cost in dollars (rounded to nearest dollar) required to fulfill these requirements?

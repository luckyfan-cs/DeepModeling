# Mamo Ode 183 A Spring System Is Designed With A 31

A spring system is designed with a 31.51-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring 1.784 ft. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is approximately 2.262 times the velocity of the weight (in lb/sec). Starting from a point 1.706 ft above the spring's equilibrium position and moving downward at a speed of 2.083 ft/sec, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=1 seconds. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, provide your answer in feet, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

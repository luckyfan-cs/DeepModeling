# Mamo Easy 440 In A Healthcare Setting A Manager Needs To Allocate Resources Betw

In a healthcare setting, a manager needs to allocate resources between two departments, X and Y. The resource allocation must be whole numbers due to the nature of the resources being allocated. The combined resource utilization, calculated as 5 times the allocation for department X plus 3 times the allocation for department Y, cannot exceed 100 units due to budget constraints. To meet the healthcare facility's service level objectives, the sum of twice the allocation for department X and that for department Y must be at least 30 units. Furthermore, to maintain balance in services provided by both departments, the difference between allocations for department X and Y should not exceed 10 units.\n\nEach unit of resource allocated to departments X and Y incurs costs of 10 and 20 units respectively. The manager aims to minimize total cost while meeting all these constraints. What is the minimum total cost required for this operation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

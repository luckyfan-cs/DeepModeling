# Mamo Easy 553 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning To Hire Employees For Three 

A human resources manager is planning to hire employees for three different positions: position X, position Y, and position Z. The company has a limit of hiring 100 employees in total due to budget constraints. Position X requires at least 30 employees, position Y requires at least 20, and position Z requires at least 10.\n\nThe average salary for an employee in each position is $\$5000$, $\$4000$, and $\$6000$ respectively for positions X, Y, and Z.

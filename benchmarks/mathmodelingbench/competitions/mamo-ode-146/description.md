# Mamo Ode 146 An Iron Rod Is Initially Heated To A Temperature Of 155 C

An iron rod is initially heated to a temperature of 155°C. It's then left in a room where the ambient temperature is constant at 35°C. After applying Newton's Law of Cooling, it's found that the rate constant \(k\) for the cooling process is \(0.032 \, \text{min}^{-1}\). Can you calculate the temperature of the iron rod after 20 minutes? Please provide your answer in °C and in five significant figures.

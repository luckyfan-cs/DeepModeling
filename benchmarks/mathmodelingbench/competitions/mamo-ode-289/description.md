# Mamo Ode 289 A Spring Is Stretched 10 Cm By A Force Of 3 N

A spring is stretched 10 cm by a force of 3 N. A mass of 2 kg is hung from the spring and is also attached to a viscous damper that exerts a force of 3 N when the velocity of the mass is 5 m/s. If the mass is pulled down 5 cm below its equilibrium position and given an initial downward velocity of 10 cm/s, determine its position u at any time t and regard the initial velocity as the negative direction. Determine its position after 0.2s in inch. Keep four significant digit number in answer.

# Mamo Ode 185 Consider A Mass Spring Damper System Where A Weight Of 64

Consider a mass-spring-damper system where a weight of \(64.25\) lb is attached to the lower end of a coil spring suspended from the ceiling, with the spring having a constant of \(8.494\) lb/ft and the damping constant equal to \(5.105\) lb-sec/ft. If at time t=0, the weight is released from \(3.711\) ft above its equilibrium position with an upward velocity of \(3.161\) ft/s (considering upward direction as negative), calculate for the displacement from equilibrium position at t=8 seconds. Give your answer in feet rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

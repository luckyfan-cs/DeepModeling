# Mamo Easy 203 A Financial Advisor Is Planning To Distribute An Investment Of 1 0

A financial advisor is planning to distribute an investment of $1,000,000 among three different funds: X, Y and Z. The minimum investment for fund X is $200,000, for fund Y it's $150,000 and for fund Z it's $250,000. Each unit of investment in funds X, Y and Z yields returns of 2\\%, 3\\% and 4\\% respectively. The financial advisor aims to minimize the total return while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all investments are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the units being allocated. What is the minimum total return on the investment rounded off to the nearest dollar?

# Mamo Ode 190 A Spring System Is Designed With A 20 Lb Weight That Naturally Stre

A spring system is designed with a 20-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring 4 ft. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is 1.5 times the velocity of the weight. Starting from a point approximately 5 ft below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 4.443 ft/sec, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=3 seconds. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, provide your answer to four significant figures.

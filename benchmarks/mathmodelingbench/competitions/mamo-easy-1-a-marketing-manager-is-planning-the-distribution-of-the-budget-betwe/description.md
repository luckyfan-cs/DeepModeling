# Mamo Easy 1 A Marketing Manager Is Planning The Distribution Of The Budget Betwe

A marketing manager is planning the distribution of the budget between two advertising channels for an upcoming campaign. The total budget for both channels combined is constrained to a maximum of $2000. Additionally, to meet the campaign's reach and frequency objectives, the effort from channel X should be three times greater than twice the effort from channel Y, yielding a difference of at least 500 points. Given that the cost per unit of effectiveness for channel $X$ is $50 and for channel $Y$ is $100, and the marketing manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (note: budgets allocated are integers). What would be the minimum total cost in dollars?

# Mamo Easy 505 A Marketing Director Is Planning The Allocation Of Budget Across T

A marketing director is planning the allocation of budget across three advertising channels: $X, Y,$ and $Z$. The total budget across all channels should not exceed $\$5000$. The resources allocated to channel $X$ should be at least $\$50$ more than those allocated to channel $Y$, ensuring that the reach of channel X is wider. The difference between the resources allocated to channel $Z$ and those allocated to both channel $X$ and channel $Y$ should be within $\$1000$ and $\$200$, respectively, due to strategic considerations.\n\nThe cost per unit impact for each of the channels are as follows: Channel $X$: $\$500$, Channel $Y$: $\$300$, Channel Z: $\$1000$. Additionally, there are constraints on how much can be invested in each individual project with a maximum of \$2500 for X, \$1500 for Y and \$4000 for Z.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of dollars due to accounting practicalities, what is the minimum possible total cost (in dollars) if we want all constraints met? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

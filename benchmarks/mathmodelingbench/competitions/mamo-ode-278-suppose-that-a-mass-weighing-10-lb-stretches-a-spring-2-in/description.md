# Mamo Ode 278 Suppose That A Mass Weighing 10 Lb Stretches A Spring 2 In

Suppose that a mass weighing 10 lb stretches a spring 2 in. If the mass is displaced an additional 2 in and is then set in motion with an initial upward velocity of 1 ft/s, determine the amplitude in ft. Determine the distance between its poisition after 0.01s and equilibrium position in inch. Keep four significant digit number in answer.

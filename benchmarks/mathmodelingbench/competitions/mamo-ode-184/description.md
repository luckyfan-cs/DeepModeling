# Mamo Ode 184 A Spring Mass Damper System Is Set Up With A Mass Of 0

A spring-mass-damper system is set up with a mass of 0.134 kg, a damping constant of 7.968 Ns/m, and a spring constant of 1.182 N/m. The system is initially stretched by pulling the mass 6.792 m below its equilibrium position and then released with an initial upward velocity of 3.997 m/s (considering upward as positive). Determine the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=3 seconds after release in meters, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

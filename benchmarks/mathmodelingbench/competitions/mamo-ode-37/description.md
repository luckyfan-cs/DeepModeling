# Mamo Ode 37 A Tank Initially Contains 3027 L Of Water With A Concentration Of 53

A tank initially contains \(3027\) L of water with a concentration of \(53\) mg/L of a certain pollutant. Clean water with a concentration of \(0.42\) mg/L of the same pollutant is pumped into the tank at a rate of \(6\) L/min, and the well-mixed solution is drained from the tank at the same rate to maintain its volume. Determine the concentration in mg/L of the pollutant in the tank after \(35\) minutes. Give your answer to five significant figures.

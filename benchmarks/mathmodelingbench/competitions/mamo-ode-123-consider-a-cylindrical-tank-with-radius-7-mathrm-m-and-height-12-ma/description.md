# Mamo Ode 123 Consider A Cylindrical Tank With Radius 7 Mathrm M And Height 12 Ma

Consider a cylindrical tank with radius $7 \mathrm{m}$ and height $12 \mathrm{m}$. The tank is initially full of water. There is a small circular hole at the bottom of the tank, through which water drains out. The area of this hole is $7.71 \mathrm{m}^2$. According to Torricelli's law, the rate at which water flows from the tank is proportional to the square root of the water height. If we take $g=9.81 \mathrm{m/s}^2$, what would be the height of water in the tank after 9 seconds? Give your answer in meters and up to three decimal places.

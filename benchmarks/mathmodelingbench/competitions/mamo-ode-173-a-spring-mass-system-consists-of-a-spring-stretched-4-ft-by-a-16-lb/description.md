# Mamo Ode 173 A Spring Mass System Consists Of A Spring Stretched 4 Ft By A 16 Lb

A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched 4 ft by a 16-lb weight, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \(4.5 \mathrm{lb}-\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{ft}\), and subjected to an external force \(f(t)=4+e^{-2 t}\) (in pounds). If the mass is released from 2 ft below the equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of \(4 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}\), formulate the problem to determine the mass's position over time. Calculate the mass's position at \(t = 0.5\) seconds, considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the position in feet, rounded to five significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

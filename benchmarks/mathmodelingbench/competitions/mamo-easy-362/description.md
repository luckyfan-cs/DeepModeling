# Mamo Easy 362 A Farmer Has Four Fields Where He Can Grow Corn Wheat Soybean And 

A farmer has four fields where he can grow Corn, Wheat, Soybean and Rice. Each field can be planted with one type of crop for the season. The planting restrictions are as follows: \n\n- The combined area of the fields planted with Corn and Wheat cannot exceed 500 acres due to a restriction on cereal crops.\n- The combined area of the fields planted with Soybean and Rice cannot exceed 400 acres due to water availability.\n- To maintain soil health, at least 200 acres must be planted with legumes (Corn or Soybean).\n- At least 300 acres should be under grains (Wheat or Rice) for market demand fulfillment.\n\nThe cost per acre for each crop is as follows: \$3 for Corn, \$2 for Wheat, \$5 for Soybean and \$4 for Rice. All areas are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of land parcels. Given these conditions, what is the minimum total cost (in dollars) to plant all four fields while respecting all constraints?

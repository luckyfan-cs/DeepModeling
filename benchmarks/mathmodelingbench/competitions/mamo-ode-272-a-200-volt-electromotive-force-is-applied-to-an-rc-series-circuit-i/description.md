# Mamo Ode 272 A 200 Volt Electromotive Force Is Applied To An Rc Series Circuit I

A 200-volt electromotive force is applied to an RC-series circuit in which the resistance is 1000 ohms and the capacitance is 5*10^(-6) farad. Find the charge q(t) on the capacitor if i(0) = 0.4. Determine the charge in coulombs as t trend to infinite. Keep one significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

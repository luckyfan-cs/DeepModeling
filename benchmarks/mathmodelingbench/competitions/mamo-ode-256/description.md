# Mamo Ode 256 Consider The Spreading Of A Highly Communicable Disease On An Isola

Consider the spreading of a highly communicable disease on an isolated island with population size N. A portion of the population travels abroad and returns to the island infected with the disease. You would like to predict the number of people X who will have been infected by some time t. On the secnd day, the number of infected people is 1887, on the sixth day, the number of infected people is 4087, on the tenth day, the number of infected people is 4853. The spreading of the disease is limited by the maximum population N on the isolated island. The rate at which the disease spreads decreases as more and more people are infected. There is no immigration or emigration. Each person in the population is subject to infection by the disease, because there is no inherent immunity and no vaccine available for immunization. Eventually, every person will be infected by the disease. (N-x) is very important.Predict the number of people who will be infected by t =12 days.

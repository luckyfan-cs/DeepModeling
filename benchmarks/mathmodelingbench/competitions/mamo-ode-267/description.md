# Mamo Ode 267 The Rate At Which A Body Cools Also Depends On Its Exposed Surface 

The rate at which a body cools also depends on its exposed surface area S. T_m is a constant. Suppose that two cups A and B are filled with coffee at the same time. Initially, the temperature of the coffee is 150° F. The exposed surface area of the coffee in cup B is twice the surface area of the coffee in cup A. After 30 min the temperature of the coffee in cup A is 100° F. If T_m  70° F, then what is the temperature of the coffee in F in cup B after 30 min? Keep four significant digit number in answer.

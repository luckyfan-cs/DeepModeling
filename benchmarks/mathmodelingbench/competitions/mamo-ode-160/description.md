# Mamo Ode 160 In A Series Circuit Comprising A Resistor Of R 20 Omega An Inductor

In a series circuit comprising a resistor of $R=20 \Omega$, an inductor of $L=1 \mathrm{H}$, a capacitor of $C=0.002 \mathrm{F}$, and connected to a $12-\mathrm{V}$ battery, with the initial charge on the capacitor and the initial current through the circuit both set to 0, calculate both the charge on the capacitor and the current through the circuit at time $t=0.1$ seconds. Assume the relationship for current over time is given by a function that takes into account the circuit's resistance, inductance, and capacitance. Provide the current's value in Amperes, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 416 A Marketing Manager Is Planning The Budget Allocation For Online A

A marketing manager is planning the budget allocation for online advertising and offline marketing. The total budget allocated must meet a minimum threshold of 1000 units to ensure sufficient reach. Additionally, the combined effort of twice the budget for online advertising and that for offline marketing cannot exceed 5000 units due to overall resource constraints. There's also a strategic need where the difference between the budget for online advertising and half that of offline marketing must be at least 200 units, prioritizing digital platforms. Given that each unit of effectiveness costs $5$ in online advertising and $10$ in offline marketing, and aiming to minimize this cost while meeting all constraints (considering that both Online_Advertising and Offline_Marketing are integers due to indivisible nature of resources). What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?

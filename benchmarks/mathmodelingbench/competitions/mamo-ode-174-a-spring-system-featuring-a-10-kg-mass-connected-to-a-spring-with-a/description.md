# Mamo Ode 174 A Spring System Featuring A 10 Kg Mass Connected To A Spring With A

A spring system, featuring a 10-kg mass connected to a spring with a spring constant of \(140 \mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}\), is set into motion from its equilibrium position with an initial upward velocity of \(1 \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{sec}\). The system, placed in a viscous medium offering resistance of \(90 \mathrm{N}-\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{m}\), is subjected to an external force \(f(t)=5 \sin t\) (in Newtons). Develop a model to describe the mass's vertical motion over time. Calculate the vertical displacement from the equilibrium position at \(t = 0.5\) seconds, assuming upward as the positive direction. Provide your answer in meters, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

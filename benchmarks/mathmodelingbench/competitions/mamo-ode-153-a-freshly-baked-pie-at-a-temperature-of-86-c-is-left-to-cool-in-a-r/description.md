# Mamo Ode 153 A Freshly Baked Pie At A Temperature Of 86 C Is Left To Cool In A R

A freshly baked pie at a temperature of 86°C is left to cool in a room where the ambient temperature is constant at 38°C. The rate constant \(k\) for the cooling process, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is found to be \(0.146 \, \text{min}^{-1}\). Calculate the temperature of the pie after 19 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and rounded to three decimal places.

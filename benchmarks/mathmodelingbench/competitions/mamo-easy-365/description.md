# Mamo Easy 365 A Farmer Is Planning His Crop Rotation For The Next Growing Season

A farmer is planning his crop rotation for the next growing season. He has four crops to choose from: wheat, corn, rice, and soybean. The amount of each crop planted must be a whole number due to the size of the plots available.\n\nHe has enough land to plant up to 50 units combined of wheat and corn, and 30 units combined of rice and soybean. To maintain soil health and fertility, he needs to plant at least 20 units combined of wheat and rice, as well as at least 15 units combined of corn and soybean.\n\nThe costs associated with planting each unit are: \\$4 for wheat, \\$3 for corn, \\$2 for rice, and \\$1 for soybeans.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum cost in dollars that the farmer can incur while fulfilling all the constraints?

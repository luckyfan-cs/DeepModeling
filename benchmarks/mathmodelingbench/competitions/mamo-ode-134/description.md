# Mamo Ode 134 In A Chemical Reaction Where Hydrogen And Bromine Combine To Form H

In a chemical reaction where hydrogen and bromine combine to form hydrogen bromide (\(\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{HBr}\)), the initial concentrations of hydrogen and bromine are both set to \(0.1\) moles/L. Given the reaction follows a rate law \(\frac{d[\mathrm{HBr}]}{d t}=k[\mathrm{H}_2][\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1 / 2}\) with a reaction rate constant \(k = 0.03\) L/mole/s, calculate the concentration of \(\mathrm{HBr}\) in moles/L after \(10\) seconds, starting from an initial concentration of \(\mathrm{HBr}\) of \(0\) moles/L. Provide your answer in moles per liter to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

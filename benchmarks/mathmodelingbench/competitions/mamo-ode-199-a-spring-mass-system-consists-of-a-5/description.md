# Mamo Ode 199 A Spring Mass System Consists Of A 5

A spring-mass system consists of a 5.939 kg object attached to a spring with a spring constant of 1.784 N/m and subjected to damping with a damping coefficient of 3.381 Ns/m. The object is initially displaced by 1.706 m from its equilibrium position and given an initial velocity of -2.083 m/s in the opposite direction. Determine the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position at t = 1 s, considering displacement away from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the displacement in meters, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

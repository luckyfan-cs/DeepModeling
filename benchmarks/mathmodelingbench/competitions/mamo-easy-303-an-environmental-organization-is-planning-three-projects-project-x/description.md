# Mamo Easy 303 An Environmental Organization Is Planning Three Projects Project X

An environmental organization is planning three projects: Project $X$ focuses on forest conservation, Project $Y$ on marine life protection, and Project $Z$ on climate change mitigation. The organization aims to minimize the total resources used for these projects, with resource requirements being 2 units for Project $X$, 3 units for Project $Y$, and 1 unit for Project $Z$. \n\nThe organization has set the following constraints due to their strategic objectives and available resources:\n- The combined efforts of Projects $X$ and $Y$ should be at least 10 units.\n- The sum of twice the effort put into Project X plus the effort in Project Z should not exceed 15 units.\n- Additionally, the effort put into project Y minus that in project Z must be at least 5 units, reflecting a higher priority given to marine life protection over climate change mitigation.\n\nGiven that all efforts are represented as whole numbers due to practicality reasons,\nWhat is the minimum total resource requirement for carrying out these projects within these constraints? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

# Mamo Easy 142 In A Military Operation A Commander Needs To Allocate Resources Be

In a military operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units: X and Y. Due to the nature of the units, the allocations must be whole numbers. The combined resource allocation for three times unit X and twice unit Y cannot exceed 50 due to logistical constraints. To achieve a strategic objective, the combined strength of unit X and unit Y must be at least 10. Each unit of X and Y requires 4 and 5 support points respectively, and the commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. Calculate the minimum total support points required for this operation, rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

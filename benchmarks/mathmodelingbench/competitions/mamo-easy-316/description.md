# Mamo Easy 316 In A Military Logistics Scenario A Commander Is Tasked With Alloca

In a military logistics scenario, a commander is tasked with allocating resources across three different units: X, Y, and Z. These units could represent different types of troops or equipment. The total resource allocation across all three units cannot exceed 1000 due to logistical constraints. To achieve the strategic objectives, the combined strength of twice the resources for unit X and unit Y must be at least 400. Additionally, the combined resource allocation for units Y and Z cannot exceed 600 to ensure balanced deployment.\n\nEach resource allocated to units X, Y, and Z incurs costs of 4, 3 ,and 5 units respectively. The commander aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that the allocations are in whole numbers due to indivisible nature of military resources.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this operation? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

# Mamo Easy 138 In A Military Logistics Operation A Commander Needs To Allocate Re

In a military logistics operation, a commander needs to allocate resources between two types of units, X and Y. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the units. To achieve a strategic objective, at least 100 units in total are required. However, because of logistical constraints, the combined strength calculated as 5 units of X plus 3 units of Y should not exceed 600. Each unit of X and Y requires $\$5000$ and $\$3000$ support points respectively, and the commander aims to minimize the total support points allocated while adhering to these constraints. What is the minimum total support points required for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

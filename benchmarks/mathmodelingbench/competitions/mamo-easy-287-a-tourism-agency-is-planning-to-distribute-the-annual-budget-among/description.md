# Mamo Easy 287 A Tourism Agency Is Planning To Distribute The Annual Budget Among

A tourism agency is planning to distribute the annual budget among three projects: X, Y, and Z. These could represent different types of travel packages such as adventure tours (X), cultural excursions (Y), and luxury vacations (Z). The total budget across all three projects cannot exceed 300 units due to financial constraints. Project X requires a minimum investment of 80 units to ensure quality standards, while project Y needs at least 60 units for maintaining the essential amenities. Project Z, on the other hand, demands a minimum of 40 units owing to its high-end offerings. Each unit of investment in projects X, Y, and Z incurs different costs estimated as 50 , 70 , and 100 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all investments are whole numbers due to accounting regulations. What is the minimum total cost for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded off to nearest whole number.

# Mamo Complex 192 A Company Produces Two Kinds Of Products

A company produces two kinds of products. A product of the first type requires 1/4 hours of assembly labor, 1/8 hours of testing, and $1.2 worth of raw materials. A product of the second type requires 1/3 hours of assembly, 1/3 hours of testing, and $0.9 worth of raw materials. Given the current personnel of the company, there can be at most 90 hours of assembly labor and 80 hours of testing each day. Suppose that up to 50 hours of overtime assembly labor can be scheduled, at a cost of $7 per hour. Products of the first and second type have a market value of $9 and $8 respectively.

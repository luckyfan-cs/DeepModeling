# Mamo Easy 415 A Marketing Manager Is Planning The Distribution Of The Budget Bet

A marketing manager is planning the distribution of the budget between two advertising channels for an upcoming campaign: TV and Radio. The total number of units invested in both channels combined should be at least 300 due to minimum exposure requirements, and must not exceed 1000 due to budget constraints. The investment in TV advertisements must be greater than or equal to the investment in Radio advertisements by a difference of at least 100 units to prioritize wider reach. Each unit of investment in TV ads costs \$200 while each unit in Radio ads costs \$500. Given that all investments are made in whole numbers because they represent complete ad slots, what is the minimum total cost (in dollars) needed for this campaign? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

# Mamo Easy 84 A Project Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Working Hours Betwe

A project manager is planning the allocation of working hours between two teams, team $X$ and team $Y$, for an upcoming project. The total working hours for both teams combined cannot exceed 40 hours due to budget constraints. Additionally, to meet the project's timeline, the combined work output, calculated as twice the work hours of team X plus the work hours of team Y, must be at least 20 units. Given that the cost per unit of work hour for team $X$ is \$8 and for team $Y$ it is \$6, and the manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints (where X,Y are integers). Find out the minimum total cost in dollars.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

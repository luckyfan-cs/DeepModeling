# Mamo Easy 149 A Shipping Company Is Planning To Distribute Goods Using Two Types

A shipping company is planning to distribute goods using two types of vehicles: $X$ and $Y$. The total number of goods that need to be transported is at least 50. To balance the workload, the difference between the number of goods carried by vehicle $X$ and vehicle $Y$ should not exceed 30. Each unit of goods transported by vehicle $X$ costs $\$20$, while for vehicle $Y$, it costs $\$15$. Given that the company aims to minimize the total cost and both $X, Y$ must be whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of a good, what is the minimum total cost in dollars for this operation, rounded to nearest dollar?

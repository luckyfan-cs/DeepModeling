# Mamo Easy 417 A Marketing Firm Is Planning To Allocate Its Budget Across Two Dif

A marketing firm is planning to allocate its budget across two different advertising channels: X and Y. The total budget allocated to both channels cannot exceed $5000 due to budgetary constraints. The company also has specific requirements for the effectiveness of these channels. The combined effort of three times the budget for channel X minus twice that for channel Y should be at least 2000 points, and the difference between the budgets for channels X and Y must not exceed 1000 dollars.\n\nThe cost per unit of effectiveness is $1000 for channel X and $1500 for channel Y. Given these conditions, the marketing firm aims to minimize the total cost while ensuring that all allocations are whole numbers due to accounting practicalities.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible total cost in dollars, given these constraints? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.

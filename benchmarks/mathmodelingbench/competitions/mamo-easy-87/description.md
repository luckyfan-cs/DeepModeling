# Mamo Easy 87 A Project Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Hours Between Two T

A project manager is planning the allocation of hours between two tasks, $X$ and $Y$. The number of hours dedicated to task $X$ can range from 0 to 10, and for task $Y$, it can range from 0 to 8. To ensure sufficient coverage and productivity, the combined effort for these tasks must meet certain conditions: the total man-hours represented by twice the hours allocated to task X plus thrice the hours allocated to task Y must be at least 8. On the other hand, four times the man-hours spent on task X plus those spent on task Y should not exceed 16.\n\nGiven that each hour of work on tasks $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of \$5 and \$6 respectively, and that allocations are in whole numbers due to scheduling practicalities, what is the minimum total cost in dollars required to complete both tasks while meeting all constraints?

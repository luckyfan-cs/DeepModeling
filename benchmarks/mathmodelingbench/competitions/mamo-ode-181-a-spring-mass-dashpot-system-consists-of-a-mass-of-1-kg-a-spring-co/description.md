# Mamo Ode 181 A Spring Mass Dashpot System Consists Of A Mass Of 1 Kg A Spring Co

A spring-mass-dashpot system consists of a mass of \(1\) kg, a spring constant of \(2\) N/m, and a damping coefficient of \(2\) Ns/m, hanging in equilibrium. At time \(t=0\), it is subjected to an external force \(F(t) = \pi - t\) N acting over a time interval of \(\pi\) seconds. Determine the position of the mass at any time \(t\), considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Calculate the position of the mass at \(t = 2\) seconds, and provide your answer in meters, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

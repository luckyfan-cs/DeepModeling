# Mamo Ode 225 An Electrical Circuit Consists Of An Inductor A Resistor And A Capa

An electrical circuit consists of an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor connected in series. The inductance is \(1.169\) henry, the resistance is \(6.13 \mathrm{ohm}\), and the capacitance is \(0.164\) farad. Initially, the capacitor is charged to \(3.0\) coulombs and the initial current through the circuit is \(11.443\) amperes when there's no external voltage applied to it. Find out how much charge will be on the capacitor at time \(t = 2\) seconds after the circuit has been closed? Assume that direction of increasing charge as positive for calculations and provide your answer rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

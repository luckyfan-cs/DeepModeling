# Mamo Easy 328 A Real Estate Investor Is Planning To Invest In Three Types Of Pro

A real estate investor is planning to invest in three types of properties: residential (x), commercial (y), and industrial (z). The cost of each type of property is \$50000 for residential, \$30000 for commercial, and \$70000 for industrial. Due to budget constraints, the total number of properties he can invest in cannot exceed 10.\n\nThere are also other factors influencing his investment strategy:- The number of residential properties should be at least two more than the commercial ones to ensure a steady income stream.- The difference between the number of industrial properties and residential ones should not exceed three as he doesn't want to overly expose his portfolio to the higher risk associated with industrial properties.\n\nGiven these conditions and taking into account that property investments must be whole numbers, along with the specific bounds on the number of each type of property he can invest in due to market availability:\nWhat is the minimum total cost in dollars he needs to spend if he optimally allocates his investments among these three types of properties?

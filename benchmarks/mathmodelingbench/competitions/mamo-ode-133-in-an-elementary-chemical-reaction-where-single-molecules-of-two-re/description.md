# Mamo Ode 133 In An Elementary Chemical Reaction Where Single Molecules Of Two Re

In an elementary chemical reaction where single molecules of two reactants \(A\) and \(B\) form a molecule of the product \(C\), following the law of mass action (The law of mass action states that the rate of reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of \(\mathrm{A}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\) :\(\frac{d[\mathrm{C}]}{d t}=k[\mathrm{~A}][\mathrm{B}]\)), given initial concentrations \([A] = 2 \) moles/L and \([B] = 3 \) moles/L with a reaction rate constant \(k = 0.1 \) L/mole/s, calculate the concentration of \(C\) in moles/L after \(5\) seconds, starting from an initial concentration of \(0\) moles/L. Provide your answer in moles per liter to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

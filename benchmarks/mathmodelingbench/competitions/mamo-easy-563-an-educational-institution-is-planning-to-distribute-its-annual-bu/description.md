# Mamo Easy 563 An Educational Institution Is Planning To Distribute Its Annual Bu

An educational institution is planning to distribute its annual budget across three different departments: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These departments could represent arts, science, and sports respectively. The total budget allocated must exactly be 1000 units due to strict financial constraints. Department $X$ should receive at least 200 units more than department $Y$ to ensure a specific program's viability. On the other hand, department $Z$ has a maximum allowable budget of 300 units due to regulatory or physical limitations. Each unit of budget allocated to departments $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs, quantified as 50 , 30 , and 20 units respectively.\n\nThe institution aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated. What is the minimum total cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Easy 280 A Tourism Company Needs To Allocate Resources Among Three Tourist 

A tourism company needs to allocate resources among three tourist attractions: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These attractions could represent different tour packages or destinations. The total number of tourists across all three attractions cannot exceed 1000 due to capacity constraints. Attraction $X$ requires a minimum of 200 tourists to operate efficiently, while attraction $Y$ requires at least 150 tourists for optimal operation. Attraction $Z$, on the other hand, needs a minimum of 100 tourists to justify its running costs. Each tourist visiting attractions $X, Y$, and $Z$ generates revenue of \$500 , \$300 , and \$200 respectively. The company aims to maximize the total revenue while adhering to the tourist allocation constraints for each attraction and ensuring that all allocations are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of visitors being allocated. Calculate the maximum total revenue possible under these conditions, rounded to the nearest dollar.

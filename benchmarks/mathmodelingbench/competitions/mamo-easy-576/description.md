# Mamo Easy 576 A Shipping Company Has Three Warehouses X Y And Z For Which It Nee

A shipping company has three warehouses, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, for which it needs to allocate resources. Each warehouse requires a different amount of resources, with the cost per resource being $\$5$ for warehouse $X$, $\$10$ for warehouse $Y$, and $\$7$ for warehouse $Z$. The total number of resources available is limited to 1000 due to budget constraints.\n\nThe company has also identified the following requirements:\n- Warehouse $X$ requires at least 200 resources to function effectively.\n- Due to space limitations, warehouse $Y$ can handle no more than 400 resources.\n- Warehouse $Z$, given its larger operations, requires at least 150 resources.\n\nGiven that the allocation must be in whole numbers because the resources are indivisible and that the company wants to minimize its total cost while meeting these conditions: What is the minimum total cost, in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?

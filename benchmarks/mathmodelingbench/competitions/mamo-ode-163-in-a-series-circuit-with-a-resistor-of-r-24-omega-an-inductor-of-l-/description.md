# Mamo Ode 163 In A Series Circuit With A Resistor Of R 24 Omega An Inductor Of L 

In a series circuit with a resistor of $R=24 \Omega$, an inductor of $L=2 \mathrm{H}$, a capacitor of $C=0.005 \mathrm{F}$, initially charged to $Q=0.001 \mathrm{C}$ with no starting current, the battery has been replaced by a generator that emits a voltage described by $E(t)=12 \sin 10 t$. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at time $t=0.2$ seconds after the generator begins operation. Provide the answer in Coulombs, rounded to five significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

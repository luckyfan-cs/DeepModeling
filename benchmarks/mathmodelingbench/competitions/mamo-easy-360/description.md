# Mamo Easy 360 A Telecommunications Company Is Planning To Allocate Resources Bet

A telecommunications company is planning to allocate resources between four different projects: $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$. These projects could involve upgrading network infrastructure, expanding service coverage, improving data security, and implementing new technologies respectively. The cost associated with each project is 50, 75, 100, and 125 units per resource for $x1$, $x2$, $x3$ and $x4$ respectively.\n\nThe total resources allocated to the first two projects ($x1$ and $x2$) cannot exceed 5000 units due to budget constraints. Similarly, the total resources allocated to the last two projects ($x3$ and $x4$) are capped at 3000 units.\n\nHowever, in order to ensure minimum standards of quality across all services provided by the company, there are additional requirements: At least 2000 units must be devoted between project $x1$ (network infrastructure) and project $x3$(data security). Similarly a minimum of 4000 units needs to be shared between project$x2$(service coverage) and project$x4$(new technologies).\n\nEach of these projects requires an integer number of resource allocations because of their nature. The question now is: What is the minimum total cost for the company given these constraints if they optimally allocate resources? Provide your answer in dollars rounded off to nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

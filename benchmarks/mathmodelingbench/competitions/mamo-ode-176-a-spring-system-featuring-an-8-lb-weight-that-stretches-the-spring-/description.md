# Mamo Ode 176 A Spring System Featuring An 8 Lb Weight That Stretches The Spring 

A spring system, featuring an 8-lb weight that stretches the spring 4 ft, is immersed in a medium with resistance equal to 1.5 times the velocity (in \(\mathrm{ft/s}\)). An external force \(f(t)=6+e^{-t}\) (in pounds) acts on the system. If the weight is released from 2 ft above the equilibrium position with a downward velocity of \(3 \mathrm{ft/s}\), calculate the weight's position relative to the equilibrium at \(t = 2\) seconds. Assume downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Express the answer in feet, rounded to six significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Ode 227 In An Electrical Circuit Consisting Of A Resistor An Inductor And A

In an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, the initial charge on the capacitor is \(5.0\) coulombs, and upon closing the circuit, a current of \(-9.697\) amperes flows with no external voltage applied. The voltage drops across the inductor, resistor, and capacitor are respectively proportional to 4.236 times the rate of change in current, 9.069 times the rate of change in charge (current), and \(1/0.259\) times the charge itself. Calculate how much charge will be on the capacitor at \(t = 8\) seconds after closing the circuit? Assume that increasing charge is considered positive. Provide your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

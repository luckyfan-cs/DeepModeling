# Mamo Easy 581 A Real Estate Investor Is Planning To Invest In Three Types Of Pro

A real estate investor is planning to invest in three types of properties: residential (x1), commercial (x2), and industrial (x3). The objective is to minimize the total investment cost, which is $500 for x1, $300 for x2, and $400 for x3 per unit. All investments are measured in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the properties.\n\nThe investment strategy must adhere to the following conditions:\n- The combined investment in all three types of properties cannot exceed 200 units.\n- The return on investment (ROI) from half of the residential property investments minus 0.3 times that from commercial property plus 0.4 times that from industrial property must be at least $50 million, reflecting a certain profitability requirement.\n- The risk associated with 0.2 times the residential property investments plus 0.6 times those for commercial minus 0.8 times those for industrial should not exceed a loss of $30 million, indicating a risk management constraint.\n\nAdditionally, there are specific bounds on each type of investment due to market or regulatory constraints:\n- The investment in residential properties should be between 10 and 100 units.\n- Commercial property investments should range between 20 and 150 units.\n- Industrial property investments should be between 15 and 120 units.\n\nGiven these conditions, what would be the minimum total cost of investment? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

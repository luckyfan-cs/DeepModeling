# Mamo Easy 99 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning To Hire Employees For Two Dif

A human resources manager is planning to hire employees for two different positions, X and Y. The company has budgeted a maximum of 50 hires due to financial constraints. Each position X requires an investment of $5000 in training and onboarding costs, while each position Y requires $8000. Moreover, the number of employees hired for position X must be at least three times the number of those not hired for position Y (considering the total hires allowed), as these roles are critical for business operations.\n\nGiven that both X and Y must be integers due to them representing the hiring of whole individuals, what is the minimum total cost in dollars that the company needs to invest in hiring and training these new employees? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

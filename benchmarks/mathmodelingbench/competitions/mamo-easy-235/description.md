# Mamo Easy 235 A Farmer Is Planning To Allocate His 1000 Acre Farm Among Three Cr

A farmer is planning to allocate his 1000-acre farm among three crops: wheat, corn, and barley. The revenue from each acre of wheat, corn, and barley are \$2, \$3, and \$1 respectively. To meet the market demand and crop rotation requirements:  - The total acres for all three crops combined cannot exceed 1000.- The acres allocated to wheat must be at least half of the total acres dedicated to wheat and corn combined (i.e., twice the area planted with wheat plus the area planted with corn should be at least 500).- The area planted with barley cannot exceed half of the total area dedicated to wheat and barley together (i.e., the area planted with wheat plus twice that of barley should not exceed 600).Given these constraints, along with the fact that it's impossible to plant fractions of an acre due to machinery limitations (meaning we need whole numbers), what is the minimum possible revenue from this year's crop? Please provide your answer in dollars rounded to the nearest whole dollar.

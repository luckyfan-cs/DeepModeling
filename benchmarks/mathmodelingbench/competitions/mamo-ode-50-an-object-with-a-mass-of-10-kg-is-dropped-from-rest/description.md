# Mamo Ode 50 An Object With A Mass Of 10 Kg Is Dropped From Rest

An object with a mass of 10 kg is dropped from rest. We assume that the air resistance is proportional to the speed of the object, with a proportionality constant of 0.5 kg/s. The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s². What is the limiting velocity of the object as time approaches infinity? (in m/s) Keep 3 significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation

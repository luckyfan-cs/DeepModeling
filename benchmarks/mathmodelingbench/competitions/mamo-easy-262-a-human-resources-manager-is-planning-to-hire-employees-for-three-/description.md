# Mamo Easy 262 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning To Hire Employees For Three 

A human resources manager is planning to hire employees for three different departments: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The total number of hires cannot exceed 100 due to budget constraints. However, department $X$ requires at least 20 employees, department $Y$ needs a minimum of 30 employees, and department $Z$ needs at least 10 employees. The cost of hiring an employee in department $X$ is $\$50,000$, in department $Y$ it's $\$60,000$, and in department $Z$ it's $\$70,000$. Given that the company aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that the number of hires are integers (since you can't hire a fraction of a person), what is the minimum total cost in dollars?

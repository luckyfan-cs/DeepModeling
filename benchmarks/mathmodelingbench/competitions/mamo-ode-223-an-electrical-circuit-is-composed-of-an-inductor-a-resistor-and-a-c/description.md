# Mamo Ode 223 An Electrical Circuit Is Composed Of An Inductor A Resistor And A C

An electrical circuit is composed of an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor. The initial charge on the capacitor is \(4.0\) coulombs and the initial current flowing through the circuit is \(2.258\) amperes. No external voltage source is applied to the system. The voltage drops across each component are governed by their respective properties: the inductor has an inductance of \(5.697\) henries, causing a drop proportional to the rate of change of current; the resistor has a resistance of \(6.942\) ohms, creating a drop proportional to the current; and finally, the capacitor with capacitance \(0.273\) farads results in a drop proportional to its charge. Develop an equation describing this system's behavior over time and calculate what will be the charge on the capacitor at \(t = 9\) seconds? Express your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.

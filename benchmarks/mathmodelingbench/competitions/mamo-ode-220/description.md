# Mamo Ode 220 In An Electrical Circuit With A Series Combination Of An Inductor R

In an electrical circuit with a series combination of an inductor, resistor, and capacitor. At the start (t=0), the capacitor is charged with 6 coulombs and a current of -16.191 amperes flows through it. The inductance of the circuit is 2.064 henries, the resistance is 4.815 ohms, and the capacitance is approximately 0.131 farads. There is no external voltage applied to this circuit. Determine how much charge will be on the capacitor at t = 8 seconds if you consider the direction of charge decrease as positive? Provide your answer in coulombs, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

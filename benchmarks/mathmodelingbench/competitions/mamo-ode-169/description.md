# Mamo Ode 169 In An Electrical Circuit Consisting Of A 2 Henry Inductor A 12 Ohm 

In an electrical circuit consisting of a 2-henry inductor, a 12-ohm resistor, a 1/16-farad capacitor, and a 300-volt battery connected in series, the initial charge on the capacitor and the initial current through the circuit are both zero. Develop an initial value problem to describe the circuit's behavior over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \(t = 0.05\) seconds after the circuit is closed, considering the direction of electron flow towards the positive terminal of the battery as positive. Express your answer in coulombs, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Complex 33 Imagine You Are On A Mission To Ensure You Re Eating Healthily B

Imagine you are on a mission to ensure you're eating healthily but also on a tight budget. You have five different food items to choose from: Chicken, Rice, Beans, Broccoli, and Fruit. Each of these foods has a specific amount of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and each comes with its own cost.

Here's an overview of what each food provides, along with its cost:

- Chicken: Gives you 12 grams of protein, 2 grams of carbohydrates, and 186 calories for $6.
- Rice: Provides 12 grams of protein, 24 grams of carbohydrates, and 250 calories for $6.
- Beans: Offers 19 grams of protein, 18 grams of carbohydrates, and 134 calories for $6.
- Broccoli: Supplies 19 grams of protein, 7 grams of carbohydrates, and 84 calories for $7.
- Fruit: Gives you 4 grams of protein, a high 27 grams of carbohydrates, and 104 calories for $9.

Your goal is to make sure you get at least 97 grams of protein, 163 grams of carbohydrates, and 2217 calories from the combination of these foods that you choose. Remember, you’re trying to figure out the least expensive way to meet these nutritional goals with these five food options. 

So, what is the minimal cost you need to spend to satisfy all these dietary requirements?

# Mamo Easy 20 A Manufacturing Company Produces Two Types Of Products X And Y

A manufacturing company produces two types of products: $X$ and $Y$. The production cost for each unit of product $X$ is $\$50$, while the cost for each unit of product $Y$ is $\$10$. There are constraints in the production process, such that twice the number of units produced from product $X$, plus the number of units from product $Y$, cannot exceed 200 due to resource limitations. In addition, to meet market demand, four times the number of units produced from product $X$, plus the number of units from product $Y$, must be at least 50.\n\nConsidering these constraints and given that both products can only be produced in whole numbers due to their physical nature, what is the minimum total cost needed for producing these items while satisfying all conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

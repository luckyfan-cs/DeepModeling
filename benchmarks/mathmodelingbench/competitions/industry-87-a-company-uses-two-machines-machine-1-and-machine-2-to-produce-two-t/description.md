# Industry 87 A Company Uses Two Machines Machine 1 And Machine 2 To Produce Two T

A company uses two machines (Machine 1 and Machine 2) to produce two types of products (liquid fertilizer and solid fertilizer). To produce one unit of liquid fertilizer, it takes 50 minutes on Machine 1 and 30 minutes on Machine 2. To produce one unit of solid fertilizer, it takes 24 minutes on Machine 1 and 33 minutes on Machine 2. At the beginning of the week, there are 30 units of liquid fertilizer and 90 units of solid fertilizer in inventory. The available processing time for Machine 1 this week is expected to be 40 hours, and for Machine 2 it is expected to be 35 hours. The demand for liquid fertilizer this week is estimated at 75 units, and for solid fertilizer at 95 units. The company's policy is to maximize the total number of units of liquid fertilizer and solid fertilizer in inventory at the end of the week.

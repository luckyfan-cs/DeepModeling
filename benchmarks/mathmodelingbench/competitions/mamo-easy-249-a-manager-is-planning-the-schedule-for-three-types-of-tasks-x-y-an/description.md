# Mamo Easy 249 A Manager Is Planning The Schedule For Three Types Of Tasks X Y An

A manager is planning the schedule for three types of tasks: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. Due to constraints in manpower and time, only a total of 8 tasks can be completed. Each task has different levels of effort required, quantified as 4 units for task X, 2 units for task Y, and 3 units for task Z. The objective is to minimize the total effort while adhering to these conditions:\n\n- The combined number of tasks X and Y must be at least 3.\n- The combined number of tasks Y and Z cannot exceed 5.\n\nGiven that the number of each type of task must be a whole number due to the nature of scheduling, what is the minimum total effort required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole unit.

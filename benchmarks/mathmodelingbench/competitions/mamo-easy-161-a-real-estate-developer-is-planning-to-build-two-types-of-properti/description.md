# Mamo Easy 161 A Real Estate Developer Is Planning To Build Two Types Of Properti

A real estate developer is planning to build two types of properties: residential units ($X$) and commercial units ($Y$). Each residential unit costs $\$50,000$ to construct, while each commercial unit costs $\$75,000$. The total number of units that can be built is limited to 10 due to land constraints. To meet market demand and maintain a balanced portfolio, the developer has determined that the weighted sum of the residential and commercial units, with weights of 0.6 for $X$ and 0.4 for $Y$, must be at least 5.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of units due to zoning regulations, what is the minimum total cost (in dollars) required to build these properties? Please round your answer to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

# Mamo Complex 179 A Hospital Wants To Make A Weekly Night Shift Schedule For Its 

A hospital wants to make a weekly night shift schedule for its nurses.The demand for the night shift on day j is dj , for j = 1, ..., 7. d1 = 5, d2 = 4, d3 = 7, d4 = 3, d5 = 8, d6 = 4, d7 = 3. Every nurse works 5 days in a row. We want to minimize the total number of nurses used while meeting all demand. Ignore the integrality constraints for now (i.e., we allow “half” nurse if necessary). Provide your answer rounded to the nearest integer.

### Submission Format

- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation

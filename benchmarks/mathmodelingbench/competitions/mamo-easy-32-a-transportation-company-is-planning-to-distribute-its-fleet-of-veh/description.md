# Mamo Easy 32 A Transportation Company Is Planning To Distribute Its Fleet Of Veh

A transportation company is planning to distribute its fleet of vehicles between two major routes, X and Y. The total number of vehicles that can be assigned to both routes combined cannot exceed 1000 due to maintenance constraints. To ensure adequate service levels, a minimum of 400 vehicles must be allocated to route X, and at least 300 vehicles must be allocated to route Y. Each vehicle operating on route X costs the company $50 per day in fuel and maintenance expenses, while each vehicle on route Y costs $60 per day. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of vehicles (since partial allocation is not feasible), what would be the minimum daily cost for the company given an optimal distribution of the fleet? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

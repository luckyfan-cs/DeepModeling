# Mamo Ode 299 Find The Charge In Coulomb On The Capacitor In An Lrc Series Circui

Find the charge in coulomb on the capacitor in an LRC-series circuit at t = 0.01 s when L = 0.05 h, R = 2 ohm, C = 0.01 f, E(t) = 0 V, q(0) = 5 C, and i(0) = 0 A. Keep three significant digit number in answer.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

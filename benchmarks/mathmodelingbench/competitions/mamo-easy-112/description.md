# Mamo Easy 112 A Sports Coach Is Planning To Distribute The Training Hours Betwee

A sports coach is planning to distribute the training hours between two types of workouts: $X$ and $Y$. Each type of workout must be conducted in full hours, due to scheduling practicalities. The total hours for both workouts combined cannot exceed 40 hours in a week. Workout $X$ requires at least 15 hours a week and workout $Y$ needs at least 10 hours per week to ensure effectiveness. Each hour of workout $X$ costs 2 fatigue points, while each hour of workout $Y$ costs 3 fatigue points. Given these conditions, the coach aims to minimize the total fatigue points while meeting all constraints. What is the minimum total fatigue score possible for this schedule? Please give your answer as an integer.

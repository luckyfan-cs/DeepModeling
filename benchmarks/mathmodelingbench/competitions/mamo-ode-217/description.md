# Mamo Ode 217 In An Electrical Circuit Consisting Of An Inductor A Resistor And A

In an electrical circuit consisting of an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor, the initial charge on the capacitor is \(4.0\) coulombs and the initial current flow is \(0.252\) amperes when the circuit is closed with no external voltage applied. The voltage drops across the inductor, resistor, and capacitor are respectively proportional to \(6.112\) times the rate of change of current, \(7.295\) times the rate of change of charge, and \(1 / 0.145\) times the charge on them. Determine the function that represents the amount of charge on the capacitor over time. Calculate how much charge will be left on the capacitor at \(t = 8\) seconds considering that increasing direction for both current and charge as positive. Express your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

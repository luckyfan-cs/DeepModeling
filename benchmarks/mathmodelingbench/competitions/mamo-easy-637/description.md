# Mamo Easy 637 In An Educational Institution The Administration Is Planning To Al

In an educational institution, the administration is planning to allocate resources for teacher salaries, classroom maintenance, textbook costs, and online tools. The objective is to minimize the total cost associated with these expenses, where each unit of teacher salary requires 5 units of funding, classroom maintenance requires 2 units per unit cost, textbook costs require 3 units per unit cost, and online tools require 1 unit per unit cost.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budget limitations:\n- The combined resource allocation for teacher salaries and classroom maintenance should be at least 3000 units.\n- The difference between textbook costs and online tools cannot exceed 500 units.\n- The sum of all four allocations (teacher salary + classroom maintenance + textbook costs + online tools) should not exceed a total of 5000 units.\n- Teacher salaries should exceed classroom maintenance by at least 1000 units. \n\nAdditionally, there are minimum requirements: teacher salaries must be no less than 1500 units; classroom maintenance must be no less than 500 units; textbook costs must be no less than 200 units; online tools must have at least a minimum investment of 100 units. All allocations are required to be whole numbers due to accounting restrictions.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for integer values for each category of expenditure: What is the minimum total cost in funding needed under optimal resource allocation strategy? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.

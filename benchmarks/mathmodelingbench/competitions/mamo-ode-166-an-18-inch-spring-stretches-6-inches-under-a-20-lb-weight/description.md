# Mamo Ode 166 An 18 Inch Spring Stretches 6 Inches Under A 20 Lb Weight

An 18-inch spring stretches 6 inches under a 20-lb weight. When the spring is further extended by 5 inches and an additional 5 lb is added to the weight, the combined system is released from this extended position with an initial downward velocity of \(v_0\) inches per second. Assuming downward from the spring's initial unstretched position as the positive direction, formulate an initial value problem to model the vertical displacement of the weight-spring system. Solve for the vertical displacement at \(t=0.1\) seconds, given an initial downward velocity of \(v_0 = 12\) inches per second. Provide the displacement in inches, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

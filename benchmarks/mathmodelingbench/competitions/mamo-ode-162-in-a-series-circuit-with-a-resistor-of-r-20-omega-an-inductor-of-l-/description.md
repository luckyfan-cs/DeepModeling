# Mamo Ode 162 In A Series Circuit With A Resistor Of R 20 Omega An Inductor Of L 

In a series circuit with a resistor of $R=20 \Omega$, an inductor of $L=1 \mathrm{H}$, a capacitor of $C=0.002 \mathrm{F}$, and initially connected to a battery that has been replaced by a generator producing a varying voltage of $E(t)=12 \sin 10 t$, and with initial conditions where both the charge and current start at 0, calculate the charge on the capacitor at time $t=0.1$ seconds. Provide the calculated charge in Coulombs, rounded to five significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

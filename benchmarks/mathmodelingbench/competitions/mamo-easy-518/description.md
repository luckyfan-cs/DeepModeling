# Mamo Easy 518 In A Transportation Planning Scenario A Logistics Manager Needs To

In a transportation planning scenario, a logistics manager needs to allocate resources across three routes: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of vehicles that can be assigned is limited to 1000 due to availability constraints. Route $X$ requires at least 200 more vehicles than route $Y$ for safety reasons, while the difference in vehicle allocation between routes $Y$ and $Z$ cannot exceed 150 to ensure balanced traffic flow. Each route incurs different operating costs per vehicle, quantified as 10 units for route $X$, 20 units for route $Y$, and 30 units for route $Z$. The company aims to minimize the total operating cost while adhering to the constraints of each route. Additionally, since vehicles are indivisible, only whole numbers of vehicles can be assigned to each route. Furthermore, the maximum capacity of routes X, Y and Z are respectively 500, 300 and 200 vehicles.\n\nGiven these conditions, what is the minimum total operating cost required for this scenario? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole unit.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

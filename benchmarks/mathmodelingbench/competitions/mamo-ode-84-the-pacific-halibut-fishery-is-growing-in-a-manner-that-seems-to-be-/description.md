# Mamo Ode 84 The Pacific Halibut Fishery Is Growing In A Manner That Seems To Be 

The Pacific halibut fishery is growing in a manner that seems to be influenced by two key factors. Firstly, the growth rate appears to be proportional to the current population - the larger the population, the faster it grows. Secondly, the growth rate is also influenced by the amount of available resources, represented by a carrying capacity of 80 million kilograms (8 x 10^7 kg). As the population approaches this carrying capacity, the growth rate slows down. This type of growth is often seen in biological populations and is known as logistic growth. With a growth rate of 0.71 per year and an initial biomass of 20 million kilograms (2 x 10^7 kg), can you help predict the biomass (in million kilograms) of the Pacific halibut fishery one year later? Keep your answer to four significant figures.

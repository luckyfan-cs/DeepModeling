# Mamo Ode 273 Suppose A Student Carrying A Flu Virus Returns To An Isolated Colle

Suppose a student carrying a flu virus returns to an isolated college campus of 1000 students. If it is assumed that the rate at which the virus spreads is proportional not only to the number x of infected students but also to the number of students not infected, determine the number of infected students after 6 days if it is further observed that after 4 days x(4) = 50. Keep four significant digit number in answer.

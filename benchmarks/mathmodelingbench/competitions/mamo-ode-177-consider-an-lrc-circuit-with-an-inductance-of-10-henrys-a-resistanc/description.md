# Mamo Ode 177 Consider An Lrc Circuit With An Inductance Of 10 Henrys A Resistanc

Consider an LRC circuit with an inductance of \(10\) henrys, a resistance of \(10\) ohms, and a capacitance of \(1/500\) farads, subjected to a constant external voltage of \(100\) volts. The initial charge on the capacitor is \(10\) coulombs, with the initial current through the circuit being \(0\) amperes. Develop an initial value problem to describe the circuit's dynamics over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at a moment \(t = 1s\) seconds after the circuit is activated. Assume upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction. Provide your answer in coulombs and rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

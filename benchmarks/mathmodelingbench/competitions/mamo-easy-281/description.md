# Mamo Easy 281 A Tour Operator Is Planning Three Trips X Y And Z

A tour operator is planning three trips: X, Y, and Z. Due to the pandemic restrictions, the total number of tourists across all three trips cannot exceed 50. To ensure viability of each trip, there are minimum numbers of tourists required: trip X requires at least 10 tourists, trip Y requires at least 5 tourists, and trip Z requires at least 8 tourists. The costs per tourist for trips X, Y and Z are \$100, \$80 and \$150 respectively. All these constraints considered (X,Y,Z must be integers), what would be the minimum cost that the tour operator can expect to incur in organizing these tours? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

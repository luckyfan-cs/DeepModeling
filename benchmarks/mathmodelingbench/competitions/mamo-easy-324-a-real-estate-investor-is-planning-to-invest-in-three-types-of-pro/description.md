# Mamo Easy 324 A Real Estate Investor Is Planning To Invest In Three Types Of Pro

A real estate investor is planning to invest in three types of properties: residential (X), commercial (Y), and industrial (Z). The investments are quantified in terms of units, with each unit representing a fixed amount of money. The total investment across all three types cannot exceed 500 units due to the investor's budget constraints. Additionally, each type has its own minimum investment requirement to be viable: 100 units for residential properties, 50 units for commercial properties, and 30 units for industrial properties. Each type also has a maximum limit on investment due to market conditions or risk diversification strategies: 300 units for residential properties, 200 units for commercial properties, and 150 units for industrial properties. Given that the return per unit of investment is \$100 for residential properties, \$200 for commercial properties, and \$150 for industrial properties. The investor aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all these constraints and ensuring that all investments are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the resources being allocated.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required given these conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

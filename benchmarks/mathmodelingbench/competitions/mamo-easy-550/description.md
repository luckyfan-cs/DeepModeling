# Mamo Easy 550 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Employees 

A Human Resources manager is planning the allocation of employees for three different projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. The total number of employees available for these projects is 100. Project $X$ requires a minimum of 30 employees, project $Y$ needs at least 20, and project $Z$ must have no fewer than 10 staff members. The cost per employee for projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ are \$5000, \$7000, and \$8000 respectively. The HR manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all the constraints (The number of staff in each project should be integers). What is the minimum possible total cost in dollars (rounded to the nearest dollar)?

# Mamo Ode 172 In An Electrical Circuit Composed Of An Inductor A Resistor And A C

In an electrical circuit composed of an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor, initially, the capacitor is charged with 2 coulombs. Upon closing the circuit, a current of 3 amperes flows, with no external voltage applied. The voltage drops across the capacitor, resistor, and inductor are proportional to the charge, the rate of change of charge, and the rate of change of current, respectively, with specific numerical relationships:  across the capacitor, 10 times the charge; across the resistor, 4 times the instantaneous change in the charge; and across the inductor, 2 times the instantaneous change in the current. Derive the function that describes the charge on the capacitor over time. Calculate the capacitor's charge at \(t = 0.1\) seconds, considering the direction of charge increase as positive. Express your answer in coulombs, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

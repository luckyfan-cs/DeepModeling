# Mamo Ode 297 A Force Of 400 Newtons Stretches A Spring 2 Meters

A force of 400 newtons stretches a spring 2 meters. Another spring whose constant is 20 N/m is suspended from the same rigid support but parallel to the former spring/mass system.  A mass of 20 kilograms is attached to the second spring, and both masses are initially released from the equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 10 m/sand regard the downward as the positive direction. What's the position of the mass with 50kg at t = pi/8 s in m. Keep three significant digit number in answer.

# Mamo Ode 231 Consider An Lrc Circuit With An Inductance Of 1 Text Henry A Resist

Consider an LRC circuit with an inductance of \(1 \, \text{henry}\), a resistance of \(2 \, \Omega\), and a capacitance of \(1\) farad. Initially, the capacitor is uncharged and a current of 1 ampere flows through the circuit. An external voltage source provides an alternating current with voltage given by \(6 \sin(2t)\) volts. What will be the charge on the capacitor after one second? Express your answer in coulombs to three decimal places.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

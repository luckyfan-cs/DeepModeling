# Mamo Ode 195 A Spring Mass System Consists Of A Spring Stretched 4 Ft By A 16 Lb

A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched 4 ft by a 16-lb weight, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \(7.279 \mathrm{lb}-\mathrm{sec} / \mathrm{ft}\). The mass is released from 2.467 ft below the equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of \(6.692 \mathrm{ft} / \mathrm{sec}\). Considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive, calculate the mass's position at \(t = 2\) seconds. Provide the position in feet, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

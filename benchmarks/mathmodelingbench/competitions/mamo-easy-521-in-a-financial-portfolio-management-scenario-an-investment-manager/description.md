# Mamo Easy 521 In A Financial Portfolio Management Scenario An Investment Manager

In a financial portfolio management scenario, an investment manager needs to allocate funds across three different investment options: $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. The allocation should be in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of the investments. There are certain constraints for the allocation:\n\n- The sum of twice the amount invested in option X, plus the amounts invested in Y and Z must be at least 10 units to ensure a minimum level of diversification.\n- The difference between the amount invested in X and Y plus twice that of Z cannot exceed 15 units to limit risk exposure.\n- There is a requirement that the amount invested in X should always be 3 units more than that invested in Y.\n- Lastly, the total amount allocated across all three options should not exceed 20 units due to budget limitations.\n\nThe costs associated with each unit of investment for options $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ are 7, 3, and 5 respectively. The objective is to minimize these costs while adhering to these constraints. Given these conditions,\nWhat would be the minimum cost for this portfolio under optimal allocation? Please provide your answer rounded to nearest whole number.

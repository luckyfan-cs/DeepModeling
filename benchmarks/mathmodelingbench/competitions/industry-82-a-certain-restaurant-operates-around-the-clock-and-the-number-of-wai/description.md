# Industry 82 A Certain Restaurant Operates Around The Clock And The Number Of Wai

A certain restaurant operates around the clock, and the number of waiters needed in 24 hours is shown in Table 1.1.

Table 1.1

| Time        | Minimum Number of Waiters Needed | Time        | Minimum Number of Waiters Needed |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------------:|:-----------:|:-------------------------------:|
| $2 \sim 6$  | 4                                | $14 \sim 18$| 7                                |
| $6 \sim 10$ | 8                                | $18 \sim 22$| 12                               |
| $10 \sim 14$| 10                               | $22 \sim 2$ | 4                                |

Each waiter works continuously for 8 hours a day. The goal is to find the minimum number of waiters that meet the above conditions and represent this problem as a linear programming model.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

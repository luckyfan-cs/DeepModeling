# Mamo Ode 156 Given A Spring System With A Mass Of 2 Kg And A Damping Constant Of

Given a spring system with a mass of $2$ kg and a damping constant of $14$, it requires a force of $6$ N to maintain a stretch of $0.5$ m beyond its natural length. If the spring is initially stretched to $1$ m beyond its natural length and released with zero initial velocity, calculate the mass's position relative to the spring's natural length at a time $t = 3$ seconds, with the direction away from the spring's fixed point defined as positive. Provide the answer in meters, rounded to four significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

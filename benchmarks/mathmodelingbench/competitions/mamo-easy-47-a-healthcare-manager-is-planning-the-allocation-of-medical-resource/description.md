# Mamo Easy 47 A Healthcare Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Medical Resource

A healthcare manager is planning the allocation of medical resources between two departments: department $X$ and department $Y$. The total number of resources allocated to both departments combined should be at least 100 due to minimum operating requirements. Moreover, because of limited resources availability, the combined effort of twice the resources for department X plus those for department Y cannot exceed 250. Given that the cost per unit resource for department $X$ is $\$50$ and for department $Y$ it is $\$80$, and the healthcare manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (Note that X and Y are integers representing the number of resources). What is the minimum total cost in dollars, rounded to the nearest dollar?

# Mamo Easy 275 In A Sports Team The Management Is Planning To Allocate Resources 

In a sports team, the management is planning to allocate resources for training hours, equipment costs, and nutrition costs. The objective is to optimize the team's performance by minimizing the total cost score, which is affected by each hour of training (5 units), each unit of equipment cost (3 units), and each unit of nutrition cost (2 units). The team has the following constraints for their budget:- The combined allocation for training hours and equipment costs cannot exceed 50 units.- To achieve a balanced program, the sum of training hours and nutrition costs must be at least 30 units.- Additionally, the difference in allocation between equipment costs and nutrition costs must be no more than 10 to ensure both areas are developed harmoniously. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers due to practicalities (since you can't have fractions in this scenario), what is the minimum total cost score for the team? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

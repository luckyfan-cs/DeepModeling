# Mamo Easy 302 An Environmental Agency Is Planning To Allocate Funds Across Three

An environmental agency is planning to allocate funds across three projects: $X, Y$, and $Z$. These projects could represent initiatives in recycling, renewable energy development, and pollution control, respectively. The total investment across all three projects cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints. Moreover, the allocation for project $X$ minus twice the allocation for project $Y$, plus the allocation for project $Z$ must be at least 200 units, reflecting specific strategic objectives or regulatory requirements. Additionally, twice the allocation for project $X$ plus the allocation for project $Y$, minus the allocation for project $Z$ should not exceed 500 units, ensuring balanced resource distribution.\n\nEach unit of investment in projects $X, Y$, and $Z$ incurs different costs which are quantified as 50 , 30 , and 20 units respectively. The agency aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that all investments are integers due to administrative considerations.\n\nWhat is the minimum total cost required for this scenario (in arbitrary monetary units), rounded to the nearest whole number?

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

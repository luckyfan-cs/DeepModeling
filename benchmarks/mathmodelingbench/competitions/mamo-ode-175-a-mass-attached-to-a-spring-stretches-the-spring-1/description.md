# Mamo Ode 175 A Mass Attached To A Spring Stretches The Spring 1

A mass attached to a spring stretches the spring \(1.96 \mathrm{m}\) to reach its equilibrium position. In a viscous medium with resistance equal to 4 times the velocity (in \(\mathrm{m/s}\)), the mass is pulled down \(2 \mathrm{m}\) below equilibrium and released with a \(3 \mathrm{m/s}\) downward velocity. Simultaneously, an external force \(f(t)=20 \cos t\) (in Newtons) is applied. Determine if the mass is above or below its equilibrium position at \(t = \pi\) seconds, and by how much. Assume downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Express your answer in meters, rounded to two significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

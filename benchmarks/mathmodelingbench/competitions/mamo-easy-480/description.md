# Mamo Easy 480 An Education Department Is Planning To Hire Teachers And Assistant

An education department is planning to hire teachers and assistants for an upcoming academic year. The department needs to fulfill the teaching requirements while minimizing the total hiring cost. Each teacher costs \$3000, and each assistant costs \$1000. To meet the teaching load, the combined effort of 25 times the number of teachers and 10 times the number of assistants must be at least 500 units (for example, one unit might represent one hour of classroom instruction). Additionally, due to administrative constraints, the difference in numbers between teachers and assistants should not exceed 20. Given these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of staff members due to practicalities, what is the minimum total hiring cost for the department? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

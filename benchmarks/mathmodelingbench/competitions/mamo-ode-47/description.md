# Mamo Ode 47 Consider A Series R L Circuit With A Resistor Of 12 Ohms And An Indu

Consider a series R-L circuit with a resistor of 12 Ohms and an inductor of 4 H. Instead of a constant voltage source, this circuit is connected to a generator that produces a variable voltage described by \(E(t) = 60 \sin(30t)\) volts. If the initial current is zero when the switch is closed at \(t=0\), calculate the value of the current \(I(t)\) in the circuit at \(t = 0.1\) seconds (in A). Keep 3 significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

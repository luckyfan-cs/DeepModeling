# Mamo Easy 160 A Real Estate Developer Is Planning To Build Two Types Of Properti

A real estate developer is planning to build two types of properties: luxury condos ($X$) and affordable apartments ($Y$). The company can build a maximum of 100 properties in total due to zoning restrictions. Each condo and apartment yield different profits, with each condo bringing in $\$5000$ and each apartment yielding $\$3000$. To adhere to the community development agreement, the combined living area provided by 60 condos plus 30 apartments must be at least 3000 square feet. Given these constraints and considering that the number of both condos and apartments must be whole numbers due to the nature of property construction, what is the maximum profit (in dollars) that the company can make while meeting all conditions? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

# Mamo Ode 243 Given Newton S Law Of Cooling Where The Rate Of Temperature Change 

Given Newton's law of cooling, where the rate of temperature change of an object is proportional to the difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature, suppose you have a cup of coffee initially at 200°F. It cools to 190°F within the first minute in a room at 70°F. Determine the temperature  in F of the coffee after 6.07 minutes. Keep four significant digit number in answer.

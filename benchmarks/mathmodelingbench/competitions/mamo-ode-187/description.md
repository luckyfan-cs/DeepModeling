# Mamo Ode 187 A Spring System Is Designed With A 16 Lb Weight That Naturally Stre

A spring system is designed with a 16-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring 2 ft. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is 1.5 times the velocity of the weight. Starting from a point 2 ft above the spring's equilibrium position and moving downward at a speed of 3 ft/sec. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=3 seconds.Provide the displacement in feet, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

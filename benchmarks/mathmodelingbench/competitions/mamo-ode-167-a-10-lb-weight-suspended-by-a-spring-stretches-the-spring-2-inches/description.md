# Mamo Ode 167 A 10 Lb Weight Suspended By A Spring Stretches The Spring 2 Inches

A 10-lb weight suspended by a spring stretches the spring 2 inches. The system experiences resistance proportional to velocity, equivalent to \(20 / \sqrt{g}\) lb times the velocity in feet per second. When the weight is pulled down 3 inches below its equilibrium position and released without initial velocity, model the spring-mass system's vertical displacement. Assume downward as the positive direction. Provide the displacement a t = 0.1s in inches, rounded to three significant figures.

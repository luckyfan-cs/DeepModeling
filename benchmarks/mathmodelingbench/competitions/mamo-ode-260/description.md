# Mamo Ode 260 Recall That The Large Tank Held 300 Gallons Of A Brine Solution

Recall that the large tank held 300 gallons of a brine solution. Salt was entering and leaving the tank; a brine solution was being pumped into the tank at the rate of 3 gal/min; it mixed with the solution there, and then the mixture was pumped out at the rate of 3 gal/min. The concentration of the salt in the inflo , or solution entering, was 2 lb/gal, so salt was entering the tank at the rate R_in  (2 lb/gal)(3 gal/min) = 6 lb/min and leaving the tank at the rate R_out (A/300 lb/gal)(3 gal/min) = A/100 lb/min. Let us pose the question: If 50 pounds of salt were dissolved initially in the 300 gallons, how much salt in pounds is in the tank after a long time? Keep four significant digit number in answer.

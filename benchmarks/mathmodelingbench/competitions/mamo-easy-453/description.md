# Mamo Easy 453 An Agricultural Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Resources Be

An agricultural manager is planning the allocation of resources between two crop types, $X$ and $Y$. The total resource limit for twice the amount allocated to crop $X$ combined with that of crop $Y$ cannot exceed 200 units. To maintain a balanced ecosystem, the sum of resources allocated to crop $X$ and thrice that of crop $Y$ must be at least 150 units. Additionally, the difference in resources between crops $X$ and $Y$ should not exceed 20 units. Each unit of resource invested in crops $X$ and $Y$ incurs costs of \$100 and \$50 respectively. Given these constraints and aiming for whole numbers of resource units due to practical limitations, what is the minimum total cost for managing these crops within their respective bounds? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

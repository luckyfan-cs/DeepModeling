# Mamo Easy 347 A Financial Manager Is Planning To Allocate A Total Investment Of 

A financial manager is planning to allocate a total investment of \$10,000,000 across four different projects: X, Y, Z and W. The projects have expected returns per dollar invested of 5%, 7%, 6% and 8% respectively.

Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

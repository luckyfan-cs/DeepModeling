# Mamo Easy 44 In A Healthcare Scenario A Hospital Needs To Allocate Resources Bet

In a healthcare scenario, a hospital needs to allocate resources between two critical departments: $X$ represents the emergency department and $Y$ represents the surgery department. The resource allocation for both departments combined is constrained to a maximum of 100 units due to budgetary constraints. Additionally, to meet patient care requirements, the combined effort of these departments must yield a minimum effectiveness score, calculated as one unit from department X plus one unit from department Y, of at least 20 points. Given that the cost per unit of effectiveness for department $X$ is 2 units and for department $Y$ is 3 units, and the hospital aims to minimize total resource usage while meeting all constraints (resource allocations are integers). Find the minimum total resource usage in units, rounded to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

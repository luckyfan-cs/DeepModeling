# Mamo Easy 571 A Military Commander Is Tasked With Allocating Resources Across Th

A military commander is tasked with allocating resources across three divisions: X, Y, and Z. Each division requires a different amount of support, quantified as 500, 400, and 700 units respectively. The total available resources cannot exceed 1000 units due to budget constraints.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following strategic guidelines:\n- The combined resource allocation for all three divisions should not exceed 1000 units.\n- The difference between twice the resources allocated to division X and those allocated to division Y must be at least 200 units. This reflects the higher operational demands on division X.\n- Division Z has specific strategic importance such that its resource allocation must exceed that of division Y by at least 50 units.\n\nGiven these conditions and aiming for whole numbers of resource allocations due to practicalities in logistics, what is the minimum total support required (in unit terms) for this operation? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest whole number.

# Mamo Easy 263 A Human Resources Manager Is Planning To Hire New Employees In Thr

A human resources manager is planning to hire new employees in three different departments: department $X$, department $Y$, and department $Z$. The hiring cost for each employee in department $X$ is $\$5000$, in department $Y$ it is $\$7000$, and in department $Z$ it is $\$10000$. Due to budget constraints, the total number of hires across all three departments cannot exceed 50. Furthermore, due to operational requirements, the company needs to hire at least 10 employees for department $X$, at least 15 for department $Y$, and at least 20 for department $Z$. Given these conditions, if the HR manager aims to minimize the total hiring cost while meeting all the constraints (assuming that X, Y, Z are integers representing the number of hires), what would be the minimum total hiring cost? Provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

# Mamo Easy 2 A Marketing Manager Is Planning A Campaign With Two Main Strategies 

A marketing manager is planning a campaign with two main strategies: advertising and promotion. The manager has determined that the effectiveness of the campaign, measured in impact points, must be at least 100 and can be calculated as twice the amount spent on advertising plus three times the amount spent on promotion. Additionally, to maintain a balanced strategy, the spending on advertising cannot exceed that on promotion by more than $50$. Given that each unit of money spent on advertising contributes $4$ impact points and each unit spent on promotion contributes $5$ impact points, how much should the manager spend in total to achieve the minimum required effectiveness while adhering to these constraints (Advertising and Promotion are integers)? Please provide your answer rounded to the nearest dollar.

### Submission Format

# Mamo Easy 36 A Financial Advisor Is Trying To Allocate Investment Funds Between 

A financial advisor is trying to allocate investment funds between two investment options: $X$ and $Y$. The investments in both options combined cannot exceed $\$200,000$, due to the client's budget constraints. To ensure a diversified portfolio, the total returns from these investments must yield a minimum score, calculated as 5 times the return for investment $X$ plus 3 times the return for investment $Y$, of at least $\$400,000$. Given that each unit invested in option $X$ costs $\$1,000$ and in option $Y$ costs $\$500$, and aiming to minimize the total cost while meeting all constraints (note that investments must be made in whole thousands due to fund regulations). What would be the minimum total cost of this optimal allocation plan in dollars?

# Mamo Easy 295 A School Board Is Planning To Allocate Teachers Among Three Depart

A school board is planning to allocate teachers among three departments: Math (X), Science (Y), and Arts (Z). The objective is to optimize the staffing by minimizing the total cost associated with these departments, with costs being 4, 3, and 2 units for each teacher in department X, Y, and Z respectively.\n\nThe allocation must adhere to the following constraints due to budgetary limitations and staff availability:- The combined number of teachers in Math (X) and Science (Y) cannot exceed 25.- The sum of teachers in Math (X) and Arts (Z) must be at least 15, reflecting certain curriculum requirements.- The combined number of teachers in Science (Y) and Arts(Z) must not exceed 20 to maintain a balanced teacher-student ratio.\n\nGiven that the number of teachers allocated should be whole numbers due to practicality,What is the minimum total cost for the school board given an optimal allocation of teachers within these departments? Provide your answer rounded off to the nearest whole number.

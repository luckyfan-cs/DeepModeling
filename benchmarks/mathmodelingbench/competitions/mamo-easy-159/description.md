# Mamo Easy 159 A Real Estate Developer Is Planning To Invest In Two Types Of Prop

A real estate developer is planning to invest in two types of properties, $X$ and $Y$. The total number of units that can be invested in is limited to 1000 due to financial constraints. To maintain a diverse portfolio, the combined units from twice the investment in property type X and the investment in property type Y must be at least 500. Additionally, the difference between investments in property types X and Y should not exceed 200 units to avoid overexposure to a single type of property.\n\nThe costs associated with each unit of properties X and Y are \$200 and \$300 respectively. The developer aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints and ensuring that investments are in whole numbers due to the indivisible nature of real estate units.\n\nCalculate the minimum total investment required for this scenario, rounded off to the nearest dollar.

# Mamo Ode 229 Consider A Circuit With A Resistance Of 1 Omega Inductance Of 1 H A

Consider a circuit with a resistance of \(1 \Omega\), inductance of \(1 H\), and capacitance of \(1 F\). Initially, the capacitor is charged with 1 coulomb and upon closing the circuit, a current of 1 ampere flows. The voltage source function across the system varies as per \(\sec^2(x)\) volts. Derive the function that describes the charge on the capacitor over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \(t = 1\) second, considering that increasing direction for charge is positive. Express your answer in coulombs, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

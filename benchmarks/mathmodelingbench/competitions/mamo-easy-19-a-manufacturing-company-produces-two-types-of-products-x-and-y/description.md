# Mamo Easy 19 A Manufacturing Company Produces Two Types Of Products X And Y

A manufacturing company produces two types of products, X and Y. The production process for each product requires different resources and labor hours. Each unit of product X costs \$5 to produce, while each unit of product Y costs \$10. Due to the availability of resources and labor, the combined requirement of twice the number of units for product X plus thrice the number of units for product Y cannot exceed 100. Additionally, in order to meet market demand, the sum of four times the number of units for product X plus one time the number of units for product Y must be at least 50. Both products can only be produced in whole numbers due to their physical nature.\n\nThe company aims to minimize its total production cost while meeting these constraints. What is the minimum total production cost (in dollars), rounded to nearest dollar?

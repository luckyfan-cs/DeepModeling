# Mamo Ode 46 Consider A Series R L Circuit With A Resistor Of 12 Ohms And An Indu

Consider a series R-L circuit with a resistor of 12 Ohms and an inductor of 4 H. A battery provides a constant voltage of 60 V. When the switch is closed at t=0, the current starts from I(0)=0. Calculate the limiting value of the current as t approaches infinity (in A). Keep 1 significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

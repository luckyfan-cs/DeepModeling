# Mamo Easy 253 A Supply Chain Manager Is Planning The Allocation Of Three Types O

A supply chain manager is planning the allocation of three types of resources: X, Y, and Z for a manufacturing process. The allocations must be whole numbers due to the nature of the resources. The total number of units that can be allocated for resource X and Y combined is limited to 100 due to availability constraints. Similarly, the sum of allocations for resource X and Z cannot exceed 80 units because of logistical constraints. To ensure production efficiency, the combined allocation for resources Y and Z must be at least 70 units.\n\nEach unit of resource X, Y, and Z incurs different costs which are quantified as 2, 3, and 1 respectively. The manager aims to minimize the total cost while adhering to these constraints.\n\nCalculate the minimum total cost required for this operation rounded off to the nearest whole number.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

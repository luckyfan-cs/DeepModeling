# Mamo Ode 157 Consider A Spring System With A 2 Kg Mass That Requires A Force Of 

Consider a spring system with a 2-kg mass that requires a force of $13$ N to maintain a stretch of $0.25$ m beyond its natural length. The system has a damping constant of $c = 8$. Starting from the equilibrium position, if the mass is given an initial velocity of $0.5$ m/s, calculate its position relative to the spring's natural length at time $t = 2$ seconds, with the direction away from the spring's fixed point defined as positive. Express the position in meters, rounded to three significant figures.

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

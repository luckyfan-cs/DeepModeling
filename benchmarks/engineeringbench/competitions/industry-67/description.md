# Industry 67 There Are Two Coal Yards A And B Each Receiving No Less Than 80 Tons

There are two coal yards A and B, each receiving no less than 80 tons and 100 tons of coal per month, respectively. They are responsible for supplying coal to three residential areas, which need 55 tons, 75 tons, and 50 tons of coal per month, respectively. Coal yard A is located 10 kilometers, 5 kilometers, and 6 kilometers from these three residential areas. Coal yard B is located 4 kilometers, 8 kilometers, and 15 kilometers from these three residential areas. How should these two coal yards distribute coal to the three residential areas to minimize the ton-kilometers of transportation?

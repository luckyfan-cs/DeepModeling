# Industry 78 A Furniture Factory Needs To Decide How Many Tables Chairs And Books

A furniture factory needs to decide how many tables, chairs, and bookshelves to produce in order to maximize its profit. The factory can sell each table for $200, each chair for $50, and each bookshelf for $150. The manufacturing costs for each table, chair, and bookshelf are $120, $20, and $90 respectively. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the manufacturing cost. Each table, chair, and bookshelf occupy 5, 2, and 3 square meters of warehouse space respectively. Due to limited warehouse space, the total space cannot exceed 500 square meters. In addition, due to market demand, the factory needs to produce at least 10 tables and 20 bookshelves. Finally, the total number of items produced by the factory cannot exceed 200.

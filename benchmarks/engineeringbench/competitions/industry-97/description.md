A company uses steel and aluminum as raw materials to produce two products (A and B). A single unit of product A requires 6 kg of steel, 8 kg of aluminum, 11 hours of labor, and yields a profit of 5000 yuan (excluding worker overtime pay). A single unit of product B requires 12 kg of steel, 20 kg of aluminum, 24 hours of labor, and yields a profit of 11000 yuan (excluding worker overtime pay).

# Industry 60 A Product Can Be Processed On Any One Of The Four Devices A B C Or D

A product can be processed on any one of the four devices: A, B, C, or D. The preparation completion costs when each device is enabled, the unit production cost for the product, and the maximum processing capacity of each device are shown in Table 5-7. If 2000 units of the product need to be produced, how can the total cost be minimized? Try to establish a mathematical model.

Table 5-7
| Device | Prep Completion Cost (Yuan) | Unit Production Cost (Yuan/Unit) | Maximum Processing Capacity (Units) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| A      | 1000                         | 20                               | 900                                |
| B      | 920                          | 24                               | 1000                               |
| C      | 800                          | 16                               | 1200                               |
| D      | 700                          | 28                               | 1600                               |

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

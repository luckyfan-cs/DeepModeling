# Industry 1 A Fighter Jet Is A Crucial Combat Tool But To Make A Fighter Jet Effe

A fighter jet is a crucial combat tool, but to make a fighter jet effective, enough pilots are required. Therefore, a portion of the produced fighter jets, besides those used directly in combat, must be allocated for training pilots. Given that the annual production of fighter jets is \(a_j(j=1, 2)\), with \(a_1=10\) and \(a_2=15\), furthermore, each fighter jet can train 5 pilots per year. How should the annual production of fighter jets be allocated to maximize their contribution to air defense over \(n\) years?

### Submission Format
- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.
- The answer must use the template `@value[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.

### Evaluation
- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.

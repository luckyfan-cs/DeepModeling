# ScienceBench Task 35

## Overview

- Domain: Psychology and Cognitive science
- Subtask Categories: Computational Analysis
- Source: neuropsychology/NeuroKit
- Expected Output: rrv_analysis_pred.csv
- Output Type: Tabular

## Task

Perform RRV analysis on the recordings. Clean the respiration (RSP) signal, extract inhalation peaks and respiratory rate, and compute time-, frequency-, and non-linear domain metrics. Store the feature table in `pred_results/rrv_analysis_pred.csv`.

## Submission Format

Submit `sample_submission.csv` with the same header and column order as the template. Ensure numeric columns retain their dtype and identifiers remain aligned.

## Evaluation

The grader checks that at least 60 % of feature columns match the reference within an absolute summed error of 1.0. Submissions below this threshold fail.

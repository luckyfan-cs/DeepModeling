- Expected Output: formation_energy_prediction_pred.txt
- Output Type: Tabular

## Task

Train a fromation energy prediction model using the NumpyDataset in the perovskite_train.pkl file of the perovskite dataset. After that, predict the formation energy for the molecues in the test set.

## Dataset

N/A

## Submission Format

Submit `sample_submission.csv` with the same header and column order as the template. Ensure numeric columns retain their dtype and identifiers remain aligned.

## Evaluation

Classification accuracy (higher is better).

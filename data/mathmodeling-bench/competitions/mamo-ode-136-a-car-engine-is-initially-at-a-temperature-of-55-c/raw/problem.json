  "en_question": "A car engine is initially at a temperature of 55\u00b0C. After the car is turned off, it cools down in an environment where the ambient temperature is 10\u00b0C. It was observed that after 18 hours, the engine's temperature decreased to 12.572\u00b0C. Using Newton's Law of Cooling, calculate the temperature of the engine after 19 hours. Provide your answer in \u00b0C and up to five significant figures.",

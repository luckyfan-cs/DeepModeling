  "Question": "A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched 2 ft by a 4.938-lb weight, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \\(6.509 \\mathrm{lb}-\\mathrm{sec} / \\mathrm{ft}\\). If the mass is released from -0.614 ft below the equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of \\(3.957 \\mathrm{ft} / \\mathrm{sec}\\), formulate the problem to determine the mass's position over time. Calculate the mass's position at \\(t = 4\\) seconds, considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the position in feet, rounded to three significant figures.",

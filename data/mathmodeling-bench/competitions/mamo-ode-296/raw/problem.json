  "en_question": "A force of 400 newtons stretches a spring 2 meters. Another spring whose constant is 20 N/m is suspended from the same rigid support but parallel to the former spring/mass system.  A mass of 20 kilograms is attached to the second spring, and both masses are initially released from the equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 10 m/s. What's the velocity of the mass with 20kg at t = pi/4 s in m/s and regard the downward as the positive direction. Keep three significant digit number in answer.",

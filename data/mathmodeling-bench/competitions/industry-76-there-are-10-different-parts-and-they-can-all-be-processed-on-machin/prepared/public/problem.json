  "en_question": "There are 10 different parts, and they can all be processed on machine \\( A \\), machine \\( B \\), or machine \\( C \\). The unit processing costs are shown in Table 5-6. Additionally, as long as any part is processed on the aforementioned machines, a one-time setup cost will be incurred regardless of whether one or multiple types of parts are processed, with the respective costs being \\( d_A = 100 \\), \\( d_B = 135 \\), and \\( d_C = 200 \\) yuan. If the requirements are:\n\n1. One piece of each of the aforementioned 10 types of parts needs to be processed;\n2. If the 1st part is processed on machine \\( A \\), then the 2nd part must be processed on machine \\( B \\) or \\( C \\); conversely, if the 1st part is processed on machine \\( B \\) or \\( C \\), then the 2nd part must be processed on machine \\( A \\);\n3. Parts 3, 4, and 5 must be processed on machines A, B, and C respectively;\n4. The number of parts processed on machine \\( C \\) should not exceed 3 types.\n\nTry to establish an integer programming mathematical model for this problem with the objective of minimizing the total cost.\n\nTable 5-6\n| Machine/Part | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| A            | $10$ | $20$ | $30$ | $40$ | $50$ | $60$ | $70$ | $80$ | $90$ | $100$ |\n| B            | $15$ | $25$ | $35$ | $45$ | $55$ | $65$ | $75$ | $85$ | $95$ | $105$ |\n| C            | $20$ | $30$ | $40$ | $50$ | $60$ | $70$ | $80$ | $90$ | $100$ | $110$ |",

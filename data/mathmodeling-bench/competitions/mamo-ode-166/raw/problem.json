  "en_question": "An 18-inch spring stretches 6 inches under a 20-lb weight. When the spring is further extended by 5 inches and an additional 5 lb is added to the weight, the combined system is released from this extended position with an initial downward velocity of \\(v_0\\) inches per second. Assuming downward from the spring's initial unstretched position as the positive direction, formulate an initial value problem to model the vertical displacement of the weight-spring system. Solve for the vertical displacement at \\(t=0.1\\) seconds, given an initial downward velocity of \\(v_0 = 12\\) inches per second. Provide the displacement in inches, rounded to three significant figures.",

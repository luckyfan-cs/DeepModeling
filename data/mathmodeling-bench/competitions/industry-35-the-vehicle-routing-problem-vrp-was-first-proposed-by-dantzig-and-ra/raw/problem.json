  "en_question": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959. It is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can be described as follows: in a certain area, there is a number of customers and a distribution center or depot. Customers are generally located at different positions, and each has a specific demand for goods. The distribution center needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design appropriate delivery routes to fulfill the demands of all customers. The objective of VRP is to optimize a certain benefit metric while satisfying all customer demands. The benefit metric is usually presented as an objective function, which varies according to the company's requirements. Common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, or minimizing the number of vehicles used. In addition to satisfying customer demands, VRP often needs to consider various other constraints, leading to several variants. For example, if the vehicle's load cannot exceed its maximum capacity, the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). If each customer's delivery must be made within a specific time frame, the problem becomes the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic variant of the VRP. There are many real-world applications of VRPTW, as customer locations often have service time windows. For instance, some logistics centers need to stock parcels during off-peak hours, and large supermarkets need to replenish goods outside of business hours. Real-time delivery services like food delivery also require strict delivery time windows. Time windows can be categorized as hard or soft. A Hard Time Window (HTW) means that a vehicle must arrive at the delivery point within or before the time window; late arrivals are not permitted. If a vehicle arrives early, it must wait until the time window opens to begin service. This is common in scenarios like supermarket restocking and logistics center inbound operations. A Soft Time Window (STW) means that a vehicle is not strictly required to arrive within the time window, but it is encouraged to do so. A penalty is incurred for early or late arrivals. This is applicable in scenarios such as meal delivery, school bus services, and industrial deliveries.\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: within a region, there is a set of customer locations and a central depot. Vehicles must start from the depot and return to the depot, following continuous paths. Each customer must be served by exactly one vehicle, and vehicles have a limited capacity. Each customer has a specific service time window, and service is only accepted within this window. A vehicle can arrive at a customer location early and wait for the time window to open, or it can arrive within the time window to provide service. Service can only begin within the time window, and the service duration is known. The distribution center must arrange an optimal delivery plan to both complete the delivery tasks and minimize travel costs. Because VRPHTW does not allow for delays, it, like the VRP, primarily emphasizes the minimization of travel costs along the routes.\n\n Now we consider a major enterprise logistics provider, 'Global Logistics', is responsible for providing precise material delivery services for multiple high-end office buildings and shops in a city's central business district (CBD). Due to traffic control in the CBD and the specific receiving requirements of the customers, the delivery task is highly challenging.\n\n**Specific Requirements:**\n\n1.  **Delivery Task**: There are 20 customers requiring delivery service on the day, and the demands of all customers must be met.\n2.  **Vehicle Constraints**: The company can use at most 5 trucks, and the capacity of each truck is 200 units.\n3.  **Capacity Constraint**: The total demand of all customers on a single route must not exceed the truck's maximum capacity (200 units).\n4.  **Time Window Constraint**: Each customer has a strict 'hard time window.' Service must begin within this specified time window. Early arrivals must wait, and late arrivals are not permitted.\n5.  **Service Time**: Due to the complex handover procedures at customer sites, a fixed service time of 90 minutes is required for unloading, handover, and paperwork at each customer location.\n6.  **Optimization Objective**: While satisfying all constraints, the company's objective is to **minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles** to reduce operational costs.\n\n**Data Details:**\n\n* **Central Depot (Depot 0)**:\n    * Coordinates: (40, 50)\n    * Operating Time Window: [0, 1236] (minutes)\n* **Customer Locations (Customers 1-20)**: The coordinates, demand, service time window, and service duration for each customer are shown in the table below.\n\n| Customer ID | Coordinates (X, Y) | Demand (units) | Time Window (minutes) | Service Duration (minutes) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- | :--- |\n| 1 | (45, 68) | 10 | [912, 967] | 90 |\n| 2 | (45, 70) | 30 | [825, 870] | 90 |\n| 3 | (42, 66) | 10 | [65, 146] | 90 |\n| 4 | (42, 68) | 10 | [727, 782] | 90 |\n| 5 | (42, 65) | 10 | [15, 67] | 90 |\n| 6 | (40, 69) | 20 | [621, 702] | 90 |\n| 7 | (40, 66) | 20 | [170, 225] | 90 |\n| 8 | (38, 68) | 20 | [255, 324] | 90 |\n| 9 | (38, 70) | 10 | [534, 605] | 90 |\n| 10 | (35, 66) | 10 | [357, 410] | 90 |\n| 11 | (35, 69) | 10 | [448, 505] | 90 |\n| 12 | (25, 85) | 20 | [652, 721] | 90 |\n| 13 | (22, 75) | 30 | [30, 92] | 90 |\n| 14 | (22, 85) | 10 | [567, 620] | 90 |\n| 15 | (20, 80) | 40 | [384, 429] | 90 |\n| 16 | (20, 85) | 40 | [475, 528] | 90 |\n| 17 | (18, 75) | 20 | [99, 148] | 90 |\n| 18 | (15, 75) | 20 | [179, 254] | 90 |\n| 19 | (15, 80) | 10 | [278, 345] | 90 |\n| 20 | (30, 50) | 10 | [10, 73] | 90 |\n\nNow, please provide an operations research model for this VRPHTW.",

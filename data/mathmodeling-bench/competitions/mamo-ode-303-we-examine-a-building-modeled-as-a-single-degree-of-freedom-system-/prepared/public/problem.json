  "Question": "we examine a building modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom system, designed to illuminate the intricacies of how structures endure and respond to the rigors of seismic forces. This building, embodying a mass of 10000 kg, is engineered with a stiffness coefficient of 500000 N/m, representing its robust resistance against deformation. Incorporated within its design is a damping mechanism quantified by a 1000010000 Ns/m coefficient, a testament to the structure's capacity to dissipate the vibrational energy induced by seismic activity. When an earthquake strikes, sending tremors through the earth's crust, this building is set to face the challenge head-on. Its foundational parameters yield a natural frequency of approximately 7.071 rad/s, a critical measure that dictates the rhythm at which the building will oscillate back and forth in the aftermath of the seismic disturbance. Coupled with this, a damping ratio of 0.0707 delineates the system as underdamped, a characteristic ensuring that while the building will indeed sway in response to the earthquake, the internal damping mechanism efficiently curtails these oscillations, allowing for a swift return to equilibrium. This scenario encapsulates the essence of structural dynamics, showcasing a delicate balance between resilience and flexibility, enabling the building to withstand the earthquake's fury while safeguarding the integrity and safety of its occupants. What's the displacement of the building in m at t=3s with initial volecity = 0m/s, and initial displacement is 1m. Keep two significant digit number in answer.",

  "en_question": "In this scenario, we have a block of copper with thermal conductivity k = 385 W/mK, density \u03c1=8900 kg/m\u00b3, and specific heat capacity C_p =385 J/kgK. The block has dimensions 0.1 m x 0.1 m x 0.1 m and is initially at a temperature of 200 K, while the ambient temperature is 300 K. Using these parameters, we calculate the thermal resistance R and thermal capacitance C.  Evaluate the temperature in K at t=100 seconds. Keep four significant digit number in answer.",

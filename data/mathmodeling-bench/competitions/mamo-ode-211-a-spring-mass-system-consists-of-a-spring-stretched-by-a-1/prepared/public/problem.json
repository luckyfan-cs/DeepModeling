  "Question": "A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched by a 1.639 lb weight, with spring constant of 4.732 lb/ft, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \\(7.001 \\mathrm{lb}-\\mathrm{sec} / \\mathrm{ft}\\). If the mass is released from 0.163 ft above the equilibrium position with an initial upward velocity of \\(6.055 \\mathrm{ft} / \\mathrm{sec}\\), formulate the problem to determine the mass's position over time. Calculate the mass's position at \\(t = 7\\) seconds, considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the position in feet, rounded to four significant figures.",

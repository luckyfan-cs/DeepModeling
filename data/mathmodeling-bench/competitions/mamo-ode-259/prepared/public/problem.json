  "Question": "A culture initially has P_0 number of bacteria. At t = 1 h the number of bacteria is measured to be 3/2P_0. If the rate of growth is proportional to the number of bacteria P(t) present at time t, Determine how many times the bacteria will be at the beginning after ln3/0.4055 hours, and keep the answer only in multiples. Keep two significant digit number in answer.",

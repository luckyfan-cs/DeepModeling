  "Question": "A spring-mass-damper system consists of a 6.813 kg mass attached to the lower end of a spring suspended from the ceiling, with the spring having a constant of 9.808 N/m, and the system's resistance equal to 6.559 times the instantaneous velocity in m/s. If at time t=0, the weight is released from 0.702 m below its equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 1.781 m/s (considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive), solve for the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=4 seconds. Provide your answer in meters, rounded to two significant figures.",

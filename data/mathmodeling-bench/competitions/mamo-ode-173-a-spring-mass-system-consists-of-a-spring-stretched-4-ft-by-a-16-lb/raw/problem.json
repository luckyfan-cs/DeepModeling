  "en_question": "A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched 4 ft by a 16-lb weight, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \\(4.5 \\mathrm{lb}-\\mathrm{sec} / \\mathrm{ft}\\), and subjected to an external force \\(f(t)=4+e^{-2 t}\\) (in pounds). If the mass is released from 2 ft below the equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of \\(4 \\mathrm{ft} / \\mathrm{sec}\\), formulate the problem to determine the mass's position over time. Calculate the mass's position at \\(t = 0.5\\) seconds, considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the position in feet, rounded to five significant figures.",

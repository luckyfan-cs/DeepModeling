  "Question": "When a vertical beam of light passes through a transparent medium, the rate at which its intensity I decreases is proportional to I(t), where t represents the thickness of the medium (in feet). In clear seawater, the intensity 3 feet below the surface is 25% of the initial intensity I_0 of the incident beam. What is the intensity of the beam 15 feet below the surface? The answer is one number multiple I_0, but only show me the mutiples. Keep two significant digit number in answer.",

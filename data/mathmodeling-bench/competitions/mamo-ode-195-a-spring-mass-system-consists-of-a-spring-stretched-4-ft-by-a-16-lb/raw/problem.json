  "en_question": "A spring-mass system consists of a spring stretched 4 ft by a 16-lb weight, immersed in a medium with a damping constant of \\(7.279 \\mathrm{lb}-\\mathrm{sec} / \\mathrm{ft}\\). The mass is released from 2.467 ft below the equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of \\(6.692 \\mathrm{ft} / \\mathrm{sec}\\). Considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive, calculate the mass's position at \\(t = 2\\) seconds. Provide the position in feet, rounded to four significant figures.",

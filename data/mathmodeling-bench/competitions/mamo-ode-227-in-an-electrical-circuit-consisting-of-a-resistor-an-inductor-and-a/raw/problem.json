  "en_question": "In an electrical circuit consisting of a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, the initial charge on the capacitor is \\(5.0\\) coulombs, and upon closing the circuit, a current of \\(-9.697\\) amperes flows with no external voltage applied. The voltage drops across the inductor, resistor, and capacitor are respectively proportional to 4.236 times the rate of change in current, 9.069 times the rate of change in charge (current), and \\(1/0.259\\) times the charge itself. Calculate how much charge will be on the capacitor at \\(t = 8\\) seconds after closing the circuit? Assume that increasing charge is considered positive. Provide your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.",

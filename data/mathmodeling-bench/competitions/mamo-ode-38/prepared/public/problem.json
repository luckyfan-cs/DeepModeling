  "Question": "A large room initially contains \\(5899\\) m^3 of air with no smoke. Smoke is introduced into the room at a concentration of \\(6\\%\\) by volume at a rate of \\(10\\) m^3/min, while the well-mixed air-smoke mixture exits the room at the same rate to maintain constant volume. What will be the percentage concentration by volume of smoke in the room after \\(86\\) minutes? Give your answer to three significant figures.",

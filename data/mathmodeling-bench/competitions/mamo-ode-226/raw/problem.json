  "en_question": "In an electrical circuit with a capacitor, inductor and resistor arranged in series, the initial charge on the capacitor is 5.0 coulombs and the initial current flowing through the circuit is -4.695 amperes. The resistance of the resistor is such that it causes a voltage drop equal to \\(6.869\\) times the rate of change of charge across it. Similarly, the inductance and capacitance are such that they cause voltage drops proportional to \\(9.494\\) times the rate of change of current and \\(1/0.162\\) times the charge respectively. What would be the charge on the capacitor at time \\(t = 2\\) seconds? Provide your answer in coulombs, rounded to three significant figures.",

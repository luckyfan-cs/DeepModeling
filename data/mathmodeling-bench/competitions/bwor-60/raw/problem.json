  "en_question": "A company goes to a university to recruit one graduating student majoring in management. From many applicants, three candidates are shortlisted for interviews, to be interviewed one by one. The interview rules are as follows: When interviewing the first or second candidate: If satisfied (scored 3 points), and the decision is to hire, the interviews end immediately. If not satisfied (scored 1 point), the candidate is rejected and the interview continues with the next person. If somewhat satisfied (scored 2 points), there are two choices: either hire the candidate and stop the interviews, or reject and continue the interviews. However, once a candidate is rejected, they cannot be recalled later even after seeing other candidates. If both the first and second candidates are rejected, then the third candidate must be hired regardless of their score. Based on past experience: The probability of a candidate being satisfactory is 20%, Somewhat satisfactory is 50%, Unsatisfactory is 30%. Goal: Determine a hiring strategy that maximizes the expected score of the hired candidate.",

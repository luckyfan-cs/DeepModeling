  "Question": "An LRC circuit includes an inductance of \\(1 / 5\\) henry, a resistance of \\(1 \\mathrm{ohm}\\), and a capacitance of \\(5/6\\) farad, with an initial charge of 2 coulombs on the capacitor and an initial current of 4 amperes. Develop a function to describe the charge on the capacitor over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \\(t = 0.2\\) seconds, assuming the direction of increasing charge as positive. Express your answer in coulombs, rounded to five significant figures.",

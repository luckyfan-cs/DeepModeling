  "Question": "A tank initially contains \\(453\\) L of water with \\(65\\) kg of sugar dissolved in it. Pure water containing \\(0.31\\) kg/L of sugar flows into the tank at a rate of \\(10\\) L/min, and the well-mixed solution exits the tank at the same rate to maintain its volume. Determine the amount of sugar in kg remaining in the tank after 6 minutes, ensuring your answer has five significant figures.",

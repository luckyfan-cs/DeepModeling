  "en_question": "Consider a spring-mass-damper system where a mass is attached to the lower end of a coil spring suspended from the ceiling. The spring constant is such that 1 ft of extension corresponds to 32 lb of force, and the damping constant is proportional to velocity with proportionality constant equal to one. If at time t=0, the mass is released from 1 ft below its equilibrium position with an initial downward velocity of 1 ft/s and subjected to an external force \\(f(t) = \\sec^2 x\\) (in pounds). Calculate the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=1 seconds. Considering downward from the equilibrium position as positive direction. Provide your answer in feet, rounded to four significant figures.",

  "en_question": "Imagine a scenario where you're conducting a series of hydrodynamic experiments using a particular tank. After completing one experiment, you find the tank filled with 200 liters of a dye solution, which has a concentration of 1 gram per liter. To set up for the next experiment, you decide to rinse the tank with fresh water. This fresh water is introduced into the tank at a constant flow of 2 liters per minute, and to ensure the tank's volume remains constant, the mixed solution inside the tank\u2014now a blend of dye and water\u2014is allowed to flow out at the same rate. Given that the fresh water flows into the tank at 2 liters per minute, and the solution inside the tank is well-stirred and flows out at the same rate, determine the concentration of the dye with grams per liter in the tank after 460.52 minutes. Assume the mixing process is thorough, ensuring a uniform concentration of dye throughout the solution at any given time. Keep one significant digit in the answer",

Your dietitian has provided you with specific benchmarks to achieve every day: 91 grams of protein, 136 grams of carbohydrates, and 1563 calories. \n\nYou have a variety of food items available to you, each with its own cost and nutritional content.

Keep in mind that your response should be a single answer question, asking for only the optimal value, under the scenario of food selection.",

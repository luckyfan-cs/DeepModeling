  "Question": "A freshly baked loaf of bread at a temperature of 200°C is left to cool in a room with a constant ambient temperature of 19°C. The rate constant \\(k\\) for the cooling process, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is found to be \\(0.034 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}\\). Calculate the temperature of the loaf after 8 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and rounded up to three decimal places.",

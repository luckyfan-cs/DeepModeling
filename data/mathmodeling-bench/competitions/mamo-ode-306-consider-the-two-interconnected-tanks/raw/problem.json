  "en_question": "Consider the two interconnected tanks. Tank 1 initially contains 30 gal of water and 25 oz of salt, and Tank 2 initially contains 20 gal of water and 15 oz of salt. Water containing 1 oz/gal of salt flows into Tank 1 at a rate of 1.5 gal/min. The mixture flows from Tank 1 to Tank 2 at a rate of 3 gal/min.Water containing 3 oz/gal of salt also flows into Tank 2 at a rate of 1 gal/min (from the outside). The mixture drains from Tank 2 at a rate of 4 gal/min, of which some flows back into Tank 1 at a rate of 1.5 gal/min, while the remainder leaves the system. Let Q[i] represent the amount of salt in Tank i at time t, where i\u2208{1,2}. Find the values of Q[i] in gal for i=1 for which the system is in equilibrium\u2014that is, does not change with time. Keep three significant digit number in answer.",

  "en_question": "An electrical circuit consists of an inductor, a resistor, and a capacitor connected in series. The inductance is \\(1.169\\) henry, the resistance is \\(6.13 \\mathrm{ohm}\\), and the capacitance is \\(0.164\\) farad. Initially, the capacitor is charged to \\(3.0\\) coulombs and the initial current through the circuit is \\(11.443\\) amperes when there's no external voltage applied to it. Find out how much charge will be on the capacitor at time \\(t = 2\\) seconds after the circuit has been closed? Assume that direction of increasing charge as positive for calculations and provide your answer rounded to three significant figures.",

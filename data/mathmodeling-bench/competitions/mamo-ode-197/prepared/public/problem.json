  "Question": "A 10.25-lb weight is attached to a spring and suspended from the ceiling, with the spring having a constant of approximately 4.732 lb/ft. The system experiences resistance equal to about 7.001 times the instantaneous velocity due to air friction. At time t=0, the weight is released from approximately 0.163 ft below its equilibrium position (considered as negative displacement) with an upward velocity of about 6.055 ft/s (considered as positive velocity). Compute for the vertical displacement from the equilibrium position at t=7 seconds in feet, rounding off your answer to three significant figures.",

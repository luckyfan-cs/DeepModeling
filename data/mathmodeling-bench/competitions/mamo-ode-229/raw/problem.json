  "en_question": "Consider a circuit with a resistance of \\(1 \\Omega\\), inductance of \\(1 H\\), and capacitance of \\(1 F\\). Initially, the capacitor is charged with 1 coulomb and upon closing the circuit, a current of 1 ampere flows. The voltage source function across the system varies as per \\(\\sec^2(x)\\) volts. Derive the function that describes the charge on the capacitor over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \\(t = 1\\) second, considering that increasing direction for charge is positive. Express your answer in coulombs, rounded to three significant figures.",

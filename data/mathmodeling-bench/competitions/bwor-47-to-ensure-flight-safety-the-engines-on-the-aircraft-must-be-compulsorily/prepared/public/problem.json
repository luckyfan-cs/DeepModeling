  "en_question": "\nTo ensure flight safety, the engines on the aircraft must be compulsorily replaced and overhauled every six months. A maintenance plant estimates that, starting from the next half-year, the engine replacement demand for a certain type of fighter aircraft over the next three years (i.e., each half-year) will be: 100, 70, 80, 120, 150, 140. When replacing an engine, it can either be replaced with a new one, or with a repaired used engine. It is known that the purchase cost of each new engine is 10 thousand yuan, while repairing used engines has two options: Fast repair: 2 thousand yuan per engine, delivered in half a year (i.e., sent in the current period, ready in the next period); Slow repair: 10,000 yuan per engine, but takes one year for delivery (i.e., sent in the current period, ready in the period after next). The plant has just received this engine replacement and repair task. It is also known that this type of fighter aircraft will be decommissioned after three years, and the engines will be scrapped after that.Question:In order to meet the maintenance demand over the next three years (six half-year periods), how many engines should be newly purchased, and how many should be sent for fast repair and slow repair in each period, so that the total maintenance cost(in thousand yuan) is minimized? \n\n",
  "cn_question": "\n3.18为确保飞行的安全，飞机上的发动机每半年必须强迫更换进行大修。某维修厂估计某种型号战斗机从下一-个半年算起的今后三年内每半年发动机的更换需要量分别为：100,70,80,120,150,140。更换发动机时可以换上新的，也可以用经过大修的旧的发动机。已知每台新发动机的购置费为10万元,而旧发动机的维修有两种方式：快修,每台2万元,半年交货(即本期拆下来送修的下批即可用上)；慢修每台1万元,但需一年交货(即本期拆下来送修的需下下批才能用上）。设该厂新接受该项发动机更换维修任务，又知这种型号战斗机三年后将退役·退役后这种发动机将报废。问在今后三年的每半年内,该厂为满足维修需要各新购,送去快修和慢修的发动机数各多少,使总的维修费用为最省？\n\n",

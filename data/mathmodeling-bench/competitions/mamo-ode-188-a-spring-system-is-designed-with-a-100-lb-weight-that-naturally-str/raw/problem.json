  "en_question": "A spring system is designed with a 100-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring 4 ft. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is 3 times the velocity of the weight. Starting from a point 2.808 ft below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 1.781 ft/sec. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=4 seconds.Provide the displacement in feet, rounded to two significant figures.",

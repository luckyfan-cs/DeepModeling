  "en_question": "Imagine you are coordinating a logistics effort to redistribute essential supplies among seven regional distribution centers. Each center starts with a specific quantity of supplies but has different needs to ensure smooth operations across the regions.\n\nHere's the initial setup:\n\n- Distribution Center 1 has 97 units but needs 119 units.\n- Distribution Center 2 has 458 units but needs 275 units.\n- Distribution Center 3 has 473 units but needs only 36 units.\n- Distribution Center 4 has 380 units but needs 459 units.\n- Distribution Center 5 has 34 units but needs 17 units.\n- Distribution Center 6 has 399 units but needs 128 units.\n- Distribution Center 7 has 163 units but needs 425 units.\n\nTo move supplies between these centers, there is a cost associated with each transfer, which varies depending on the route. Here's the cost matrix showing the cost to transfer supplies from one center to another:\n\n- From/To Center 1: To 2 costs 41, to 3 costs 42, to 4 costs 31, to 5 costs 39, to 6 costs 2, to 7 costs 18.\n- From/To Center 2: To 1 costs 48, to 3 costs 9, to 4 costs 22, to 5 costs 47, to 6 costs 29, to 7 costs 39.\n- From/To Center 3: To 1 costs 36, to 2 costs 22, to 4 costs 29, to 5 costs 45, to 6 costs 33, to 7 costs 45.\n- From/To Center 4: To 1 costs 19, to 2 costs 5, to 3 costs 10, to 5 costs 3, to 6 costs 42, to 7 costs 20.\n- From/To Center 5: To 1 costs 13, to 2 costs 10, to 3 costs 21, to 4 costs 7, to 6 costs 35, to 7 costs 11.\n- From/To Center 6: To 1 costs 5, to 2 costs 35, to 3 costs 29, to 4 costs 16, to 5 costs 40, to 7 costs 9.\n- From/To Center 7: To 1 costs 7, to 2 costs 24, to 3 costs 26, to 4 costs 38, to 5 costs 33, to 6 costs 13.\n\nYour task is to ensure each distribution center has the supplies it needs while minimizing the total cost of redistribution. What would be the minimum cost to achieve this?",

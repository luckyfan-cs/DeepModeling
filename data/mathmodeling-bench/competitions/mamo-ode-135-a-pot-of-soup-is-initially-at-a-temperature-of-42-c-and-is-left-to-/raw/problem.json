  "en_question": "A pot of soup is initially at a temperature of 42\u00b0C and is left to cool in a room with a constant ambient temperature of 7\u00b0C. After 11 minutes, the temperature of the soup has decreased to approximately 31.079\u00b0C. By applying Newton's Law of Cooling, calculate the temperature of the soup after 20 minutes. Provide your answer in \u00b0C and in five significant figures.",

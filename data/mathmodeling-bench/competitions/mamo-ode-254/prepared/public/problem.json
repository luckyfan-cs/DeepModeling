  "Question": "Suppose that a sum of money is deposited in a bank or money fund that pays interest at an annual rate r. The value S(t) of the investment at any time t depends on the frequency with which interest is compounded as well as on the interest rate. Financial institutions have various policies concerning compounding: some compound monthly, some weekly, some even daily. If we assume that compounding takes place continuously, then we can set up an initial value problem that describes the growth of the investment. For instance, suppose that one opens an individual retirement account (IRA) at age 25 and makes annual investments of $2000 thereafter in a continuous manner. Assuming a rate of return of 7.5%, what will be the balance in the IRA at age 65? We have S0 = 0, r = 0.075, and k = $2000, and we wish to determine S(40) in $. Keep eight significant digit number in answer.",

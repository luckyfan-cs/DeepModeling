  "en_question": "A blacksmith heats an iron rod to a temperature of 72\u00b0C and then leaves it to cool in a room where the ambient temperature is constantly maintained at 10\u00b0C. After 4 minutes, the temperature of the rod has decreased to 39.112\u00b0C. Using Newton's Law of Cooling, calculate the temperature of the iron rod after 15 minutes. Provide your answer in \u00b0C and up to five significant figures.",

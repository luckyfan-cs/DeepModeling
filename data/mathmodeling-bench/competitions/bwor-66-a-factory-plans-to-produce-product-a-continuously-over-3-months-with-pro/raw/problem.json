  "en_question": "A factory plans to produce Product A continuously over 3 months, with production starting at the beginning of each month. The production cost for A is x^2, where x is the quantity of A produced in that month. The inventory holding cost is 1 yuan per unit per month. The demand for the 3 months is estimated as: d_1 = 100, d_2 = 110, d_3 = 120. Assume that: The starting inventory at the beginning of the first month is s_0 = 0, The ending inventory at the end of the third month is s_3 = 0. Question: What should be the monthly production quantities in order to minimize the total production and inventory costs?",

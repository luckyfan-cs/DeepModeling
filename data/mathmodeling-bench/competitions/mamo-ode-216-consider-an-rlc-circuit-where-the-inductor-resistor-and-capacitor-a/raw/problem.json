  "en_question": "Consider an RLC circuit where the inductor, resistor, and capacitor are connected in series. The inductance of the circuit is \\(8.126\\) henry, the resistance is \\(5.024 \\Omega\\), and the capacitance is \\(0.411 F\\). Initially, the charge on the capacitor is \\(4.0 C\\) and the current flowing through it is \\(3.276 A\\). Assuming no external voltage source, find out how much charge will be on the capacitor at time \\(t = 7 s\\). Consider a positive direction for increasing charge. Express your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.",

  "en_question": "\n\n  A machine tool has 5 hours of available working time per day. Producing one unit of Product A or Product B each requires 1 hour. The costs per unit are 4 yuan for A and 3 yuan for B. The selling prices of each product depend linearly on their respective output quantities, as follows: \n\n  $$\n  \\begin{array}{l}{p_{1}\\,=\\,12-x_{1}}\\\\ {p_{2}\\,=\\,13-2x_{2}}\\end{array}\n  $$  \n\n where $x_{1} and x_{2}$ represent the quantities produced of Product A and Product B, respectively. Question: If the machine must operate 5 hours per day, how many units of A and B should be produced to maximize total profit? \n\n",

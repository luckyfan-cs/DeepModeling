  "Question": "A 200-volt electromotive force is applied to an RC-series circuit in which the resistance is 1000 ohms and the capacitance is 5*10^(-6) farad. Find the charge q(t) on the capacitor if i(0) = 0.4. Determine the charge in coulombs as t trend to infinite. Keep one significant digit number in answer.",

  "en_question": "A blacksmith is heating an iron rod at a temperature of 177\u00b0C in a furnace. The rod is then taken out and left to cool in the environment with a constant ambient temperature of 36\u00b0C. According to Newton's Law of Cooling, the rate constant \\(k\\) for the cooling process is found to be \\(0.127 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}\\). Determine the temperature of the iron rod after 20 minutes. Provide your answer in \u00b0C and rounded off to two decimal places.",

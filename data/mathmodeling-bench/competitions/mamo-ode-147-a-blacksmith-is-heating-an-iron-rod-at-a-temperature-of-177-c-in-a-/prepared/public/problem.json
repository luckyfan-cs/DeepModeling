  "Question": "A blacksmith is heating an iron rod at a temperature of 177°C in a furnace. The rod is then taken out and left to cool in the environment with a constant ambient temperature of 36°C. According to Newton's Law of Cooling, the rate constant \\(k\\) for the cooling process is found to be \\(0.127 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}\\). Determine the temperature of the iron rod after 20 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and rounded off to two decimal places.",

  "en_question": "A mass attached to a spring stretches the spring \\(1.96 \\mathrm{m}\\) to reach its equilibrium position. In a viscous medium with resistance equal to 4 times the velocity (in \\(\\mathrm{m/s}\\)), the mass is pulled down \\(2 \\mathrm{m}\\) below equilibrium and released with a \\(3 \\mathrm{m/s}\\) downward velocity. Simultaneously, an external force \\(f(t)=20 \\cos t\\) (in Newtons) is applied. Determine if the mass is above or below its equilibrium position at \\(t = \\pi\\) seconds, and by how much. Assume downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Express your answer in meters, rounded to two significant figures.",

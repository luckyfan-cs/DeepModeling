  "Question": "A spring system is designed with a 16.252-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring 6 inches. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is approximately 1.414 times the velocity of the weight. Starting from a point 3.387 ft below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 5.047 ft/sec. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=2 seconds.Provide the displacement in feet, rounded to four significant figures.",

  "en_question": "A spring system, featuring an 8-lb weight that stretches the spring 4 ft, is immersed in a medium with resistance equal to 1.5 times the velocity (in \\(\\mathrm{ft/s}\\)). An external force \\(f(t)=6+e^{-t}\\) (in pounds) acts on the system. If the weight is released from 2 ft above the equilibrium position with a downward velocity of \\(3 \\mathrm{ft/s}\\), calculate the weight's position relative to the equilibrium at \\(t = 2\\) seconds. Assume downward from the equilibrium position as positive. Express the answer in feet, rounded to six significant figures.",

  "en_question": "A fighter jet is a crucial combat tool, but to make a fighter jet effective, enough pilots are required. Therefore, a portion of the produced fighter jets, besides those used directly in combat, must be allocated for training pilots. Given that the annual production of fighter jets is \\(a_j(j=1, 2)\\), with \\(a_1=10\\) and \\(a_2=15\\), furthermore, each fighter jet can train 5 pilots per year. How should the annual production of fighter jets be allocated to maximize their contribution to air defense over \\(n\\) years?",

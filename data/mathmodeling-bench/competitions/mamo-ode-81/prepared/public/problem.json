  "Question": "A cancerous tumor initially contains \\(10^4\\) cells and is increasing at a rate of \\(20\\%\\) per unit time, following the Gompertzian growth model with a retarding constant \\(\\alpha\\) of \\(0.02\\). Calculate the limiting number of cells in the tumor, using the provided growth rate and retarding constant. Keep you answer to 6 significant figures.",

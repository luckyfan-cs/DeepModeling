  "Question": "A blacksmith heats a piece of iron to 105°C and then leaves it to cool in a room where the ambient temperature is 33°C. After 9 minutes, the temperature of the iron has decreased to approximately 49.754°C. Assuming that the cooling process follows Newton's Law of Cooling, calculate the temperature of the iron after 19 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and in five significant figures.",

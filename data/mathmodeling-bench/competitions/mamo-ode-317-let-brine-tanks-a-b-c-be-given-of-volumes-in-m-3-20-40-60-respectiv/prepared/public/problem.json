  "Question": "Let brine tanks A, B, C be given of volumes in m^3 20, 40, 60, respectively. Brine tank A is the first in the series, receiving an inflow of water. It is connected to tank B, which is in turn connected to tank C. The setup suggests that fluid flows from tank A to tank B and then from tank B to tank C at a consistent rate. Each tank also has an outflow, indicating that fluid leaves each tank after passing through. The arrangement is designed to maintain a constant volume of fluid in each tank as the fluid moves through the system. The tanks are positioned in such a way that gravity could aid the flow from one tank to the next in a stepwise fashion. It is supposed that fluid enters tank A at rate r, drains from A to B at rate r, drains from B to C at rate r, then drains from tank C at rate r. Hence the volumes of the tanks remain constant. Let r = 10 m^3/s, to illustrate the ideas. Uniform stirring of each tank is assumed, which implies uniform salt concentration throughout each tank. Let x1(t), x2(t), x3(t) denote the amount of salt at time t in each tank. Assume x1(0) = 15 pounds, x2(0) = 25 pounds, x3(0) = 20 pounds. We suppose added to tank A water containing no salt. Therefore, the salt in all the tanks is eventually lost from the drains. The cascade is modeled by the chemical balance law rate of change = input rate - output rate. Find the amount of salt at t = 10s in tank A in pounds. Keep three significant number in answer.",

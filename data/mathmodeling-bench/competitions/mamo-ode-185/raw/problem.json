  "en_question": "Consider a mass-spring-damper system where a weight of \\(64.25\\) lb is attached to the lower end of a coil spring suspended from the ceiling, with the spring having a constant of \\(8.494\\) lb/ft and the damping constant equal to \\(5.105\\) lb-sec/ft. If at time t=0, the weight is released from \\(3.711\\) ft above its equilibrium position with an upward velocity of \\(3.161\\) ft/s (considering upward direction as negative), calculate for the displacement from equilibrium position at t=8 seconds. Give your answer in feet rounded to three significant figures.",

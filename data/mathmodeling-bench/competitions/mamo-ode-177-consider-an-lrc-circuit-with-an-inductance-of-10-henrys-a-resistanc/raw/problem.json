  "en_question": "Consider an LRC circuit with an inductance of \\(10\\) henrys, a resistance of \\(10\\) ohms, and a capacitance of \\(1/500\\) farads, subjected to a constant external voltage of \\(100\\) volts. The initial charge on the capacitor is \\(10\\) coulombs, with the initial current through the circuit being \\(0\\) amperes. Develop an initial value problem to describe the circuit's dynamics over time. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at a moment \\(t = 1s\\) seconds after the circuit is activated. Assume upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction. Provide your answer in coulombs and rounded to three significant figures.",

  "Question": "A large tank initially contains \\(1317\\) L of water with a concentration of \\(28\\) kg/L of a certain pollutant. Fresh water enters the tank at a rate of \\(2\\) L/min and carries with it the pollutant at a concentration of \\(0.4\\) kg/L, while the well-mixed solution exits the tank at the same rate. Determine the amount in kilograms of pollutant remaining in the tank after \\(36\\) minutes. Express your answer to five significant figures.",

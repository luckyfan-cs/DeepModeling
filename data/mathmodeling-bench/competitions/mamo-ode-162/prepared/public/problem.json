  "Question": "In a series circuit with a resistor of $R=20 \\Omega$, an inductor of $L=1 \\mathrm{H}$, a capacitor of $C=0.002 \\mathrm{F}$, and initially connected to a battery that has been replaced by a generator producing a varying voltage of $E(t)=12 \\sin 10 t$, and with initial conditions where both the charge and current start at 0, calculate the charge on the capacitor at time $t=0.1$ seconds. Provide the calculated charge in Coulombs, rounded to five significant figures.",

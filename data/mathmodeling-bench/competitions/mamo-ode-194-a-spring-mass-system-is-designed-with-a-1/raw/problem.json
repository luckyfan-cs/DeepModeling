  "en_question": "A spring-mass system is designed with a 1.44 lb weight that naturally stretches the spring by 2 inches. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is equivalent to \\(4.933 \\times \\sqrt{g}\\) times the velocity of the weight, where g is the acceleration due to gravity in ft/sec\\(^2\\). If at time t=0, the weight is released from 1.531 inches below its equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 0.801 inches/sec, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=3 seconds considering upward as positive direction. Provide your answer in inches rounded to three significant figures.",

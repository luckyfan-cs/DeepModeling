  "en_question": "A fabric dyeing plant has 3 dyeing vats. Each batch of fabric must be dyed in sequence in each vat: first, the second, and third vats. The plant must color five batches of fabric of different sizes. The time required in hours to dye batch $i$ in vat $j$ is given in the following matrix:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{ccc}\n3 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 1.5 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 1.2 & 1.3 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n2.1 & 2 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\n\nSchedule the dyeing operations in the vats to minimize the completion time of the last batch.",

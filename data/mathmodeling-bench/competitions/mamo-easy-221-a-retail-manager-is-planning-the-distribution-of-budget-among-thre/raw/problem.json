  "en_question": "A retail manager is planning the distribution of budget among three departments: X (Buying), Y (Marketing), and Z (Logistics). The total budget for all departments combined is limited to a maximum of 1000 units due to financial constraints. Department X requires at least 200 units, department Y needs a minimum of 150 units, and department Z must receive at least 50 units to function effectively. Each unit invested in departments X, Y, and Z generates returns quantified as 2, 3, and 1 unit respectively. The retail manager aims to minimize the total cost while meeting these investment constraints for each department. Given that all investments need to be whole numbers due to accounting policies, calculate the minimum total cost required for this scenario.",

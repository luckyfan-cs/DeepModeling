It is known that the factory has 15,000 production hours per quarter, and each unit of products I, II, and III requires 2, 4, and 3 hours respectively. Due to a change in equipment, product I cannot be produced in the second quarter. It is stipulated that if the products cannot be delivered on time, a compensation of 20 yuan per unit per quarter delay is required for products I and II, while for product III, the compensation is 10 yuan. Additionally, for products produced but not delivered in the current quarter, the inventory cost is 5 yuan per unit per quarter.

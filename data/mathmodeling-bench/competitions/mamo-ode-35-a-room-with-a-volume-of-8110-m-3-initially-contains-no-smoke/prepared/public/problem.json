  "Question": "A room with a volume of \\(8110\\) m^3 initially contains no smoke. A machine is introduced into the room that generates smoke at a concentration of \\(0.29\\%\\) and emits it into the room at a rate of \\(2\\) m^3/min. At the same time, air (with the mixed in smoke) is vented out of the room at a rate of \\(2\\) m^3/min to maintain constant volume. Calculate the percentage concentration of smoke in the room after \\(12\\) minutes. Provide your answer to one significant figures.",

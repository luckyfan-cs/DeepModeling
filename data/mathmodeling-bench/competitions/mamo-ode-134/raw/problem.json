  "en_question": "In a chemical reaction where hydrogen and bromine combine to form hydrogen bromide (\\(\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{Br}_2 \\rightarrow 2 \\mathrm{HBr}\\)), the initial concentrations of hydrogen and bromine are both set to \\(0.1\\) moles/L. Given the reaction follows a rate law \\(\\frac{d[\\mathrm{HBr}]}{d t}=k[\\mathrm{H}_2][\\mathrm{Br}_2]^{1 / 2}\\) with a reaction rate constant \\(k = 0.03\\) L/mole/s, calculate the concentration of \\(\\mathrm{HBr}\\) in moles/L after \\(10\\) seconds, starting from an initial concentration of \\(\\mathrm{HBr}\\) of \\(0\\) moles/L. Provide your answer in moles per liter to three significant figures.",

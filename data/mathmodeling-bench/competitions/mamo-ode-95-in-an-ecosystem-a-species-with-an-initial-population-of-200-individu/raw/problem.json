  "en_question": "In an ecosystem, a species with an initial population of 200 individuals exhibits seasonal changes in its growth rate, modeled by a cosine function reflecting variations in food availability. Given a maximum growth rate of 0.05 per month, a seasonal cycle frequency of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) per month, and a phase shift of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) radians, calculate the population after 6 months. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.",

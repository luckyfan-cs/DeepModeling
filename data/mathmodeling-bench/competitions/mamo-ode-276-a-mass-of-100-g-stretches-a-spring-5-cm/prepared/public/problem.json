  "Question": "A mass of 100 g stretches a spring 5 cm. If the mass is set in motion from its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 10 cm/s, and if there is no damping, determine the position u of the mass at any time t. Determine the distance between its poisition after 0.2283s and equilibrium position in cm. Keep one significant digit number in answer.",

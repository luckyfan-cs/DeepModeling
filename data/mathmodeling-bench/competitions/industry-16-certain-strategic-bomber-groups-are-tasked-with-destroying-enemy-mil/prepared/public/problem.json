  "en_question": " Certain strategic bomber groups are tasked with destroying enemy military targets. It is known that the target has four key parts, and destroying at least two of them will suffice. \n\nResources and constraints:\n\nBomb stockpile: A maximum of 28 heavy bombs and 12 light bombs can be used.\nFuel limit: Total fuel consumption must not exceed 10,000 liters.\nFuel consumption rules: When carrying heavy bombs, each liter of fuel allows a distance of 2 km, whereas with light bombs, each liter allows 3 km. Additionally, each aircraft can only carry one bomb per trip, and each bombing run requires fuel not only for the round trip (each liter of fuel allows 4 km when the aircraft is empty) but also 100 liters for both takeoff and landing per trip. \n\nTable 1-17\n| Key Part | Distance from Airport (km) | Probability of Destruction per Heavy Bomb | Probability of Destruction per Light Bomb |\n|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|          |                            |                                         |                                          |\n| 1        | 450                        | 0.03                                    | 0.08                                     |\n| 2        | 480                        | 0.10                                    | 0.11                                     |\n| 3        | 540                        | 0.05                                    | 0.12                                     |\n| 4        | 600                        | 0.05                                    | 0.09                                     |\n\nHow should the bombing plan be determined to maximize the probability of success?

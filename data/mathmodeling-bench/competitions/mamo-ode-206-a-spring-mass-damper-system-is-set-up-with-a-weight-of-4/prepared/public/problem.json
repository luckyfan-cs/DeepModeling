  "Question": "A spring-mass-damper system is set up with a weight of 4.451 lb, a damping constant of 7.136 lb-s/ft and a spring constant of 2.064 lb/ft. The weight is initially pulled up by 6.95 ft above its equilibrium position and then released with an initial downward velocity of 6.048 ft/s (downward direction considered positive). Determine the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=5 seconds in feet, rounded to three significant figures.",

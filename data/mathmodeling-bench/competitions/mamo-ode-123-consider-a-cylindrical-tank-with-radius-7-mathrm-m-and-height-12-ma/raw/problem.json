  "en_question": "Consider a cylindrical tank with radius $7 \\mathrm{m}$ and height $12 \\mathrm{m}$. The tank is initially full of water. There is a small circular hole at the bottom of the tank, through which water drains out. The area of this hole is $7.71 \\mathrm{m}^2$. According to Torricelli's law, the rate at which water flows from the tank is proportional to the square root of the water height. If we take $g=9.81 \\mathrm{m/s}^2$, what would be the height of water in the tank after 9 seconds? Give your answer in meters and up to three decimal places.",

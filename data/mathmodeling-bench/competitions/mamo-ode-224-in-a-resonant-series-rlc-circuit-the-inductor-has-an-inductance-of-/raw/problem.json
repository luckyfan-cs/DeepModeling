  "en_question": "In a resonant series RLC circuit, the inductor has an inductance of \\(7.968\\) henry, the resistor has a resistance of \\(4.859 \\Omega\\), and the capacitor has a capacitance of \\(0.212\\) farad. At time zero, the charge on the capacitor is \\(2.0\\) coulombs and current flow is \\(-4.854\\) amperes indicating that it flows from negative to positive terminal of voltage source. If no external voltage is applied, determine the charge on the capacitor at time \\(t = 9\\) seconds assuming that direction of increasing charge as positive. Express your answer in coulombs rounded to three significant figures.",

  "en_question": "Consider three ponds connected by streams. The first pond has a pollution source, which spreads via the connecting streams to the other ponds. The plan is to determine the amount of pollutant in each pond. Three ponds 1, 2, 3 of volumes V1, V2, V3 connected by streams. The pollution source f(t) is in pond 1. Assume the following. Symbol f(t) is the pollutant flow rate into pond 1 (lb/min). Symbols f1 = 100, f2 = 100, f3 = 50 denote the pollutant flow rates out of ponds 1, 2, 3, respectively (gal/min). It is assumed that the pollutant is well-mixed in each pond. The three ponds have volumes V1, V2, V3 (gal), which remain constant. Symbols x1(t), x2(t), x3(t) denote the amount (lbs) of pollutant in ponds 1, 2, 3, respectively. x1(0) = x2(0) = x3(0) = 0. Predict the pollutant amounts in pounds of the ponds after 48 hours in pond 3. keep answer in four significant digit number.",

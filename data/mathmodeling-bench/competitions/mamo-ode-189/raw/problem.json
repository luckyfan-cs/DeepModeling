  "en_question": "A spring-mass system is designed with a weight that naturally stretches the spring 1 meter. The system experiences resistance in a medium equivalent to 3.957 m/s. Starting from a point 0.614 meters below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at an initial speed, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=4 seconds. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, provide the displacement in meters, rounded to three significant figures.",

  "en_question": "A team of biologists is studying the growth of a certain type of tissue culture. They observed that most cell divisions occur on the periphery of the tissue and the number of cells on the periphery is proportional to the square root of the tissue area. The rate of growth of the area is jointly proportional to the square root of the current area and the difference between the final and current area. They started with a tissue area of 100 square meters. The biologists found that the tissue stopped growing when it reached a size of 1000 square meters. They also determined that the constant of proportionality is 0.001 per hour. They want to know the size of the tissue after 60 hours. Can you help them calculate this? Keep six significant figures.",

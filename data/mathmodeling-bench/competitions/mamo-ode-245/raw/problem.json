  "en_question": "The logistic model has been applied to the natural growth of the halibut population in certain areas of the Pacific Ocean. Let y, measured in kilograms, be the total mass, or biomass, of the halibut population at time t. The parameters in the logistic equation are estimated to have the values r = 0.71/year and K = 80.5 * 10^6 kg. If the initial biomass is y_0 = 0.25K, find the biomass in kg 2 years later. Keep nine siginigicant digit number in answer.",

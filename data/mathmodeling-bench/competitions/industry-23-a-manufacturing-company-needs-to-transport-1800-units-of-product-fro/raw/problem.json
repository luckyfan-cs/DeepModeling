  "en_question": "A manufacturing company needs to transport 1800 units of product from the warehouse to three different sales points. The company has four transportation options to choose from: truck, van, motorcycle, and electric vehicle. Since the van and electric vehicle both consume a lot of energy, the company wants to choose only one of these two options. Each trip with a truck generates 100 units of pollution, a van generates 50 units of pollution, a motorcycle generates 10 units of pollution, and an electric vehicle generates 0 units of pollution. The total pollution generated from all trips cannot exceed 2000 units. At least 10 trips must use a truck. Trucks, vans, motorcycles, and electric vehicles can transport 100 units, 80 units, 40 units, and 60 units of product per trip, respectively. The company needs to ensure that the total amount of transported product is at least 1800 units.",

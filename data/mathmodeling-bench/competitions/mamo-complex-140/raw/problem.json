  "en_question": "In the strategic planning of WareCo's distribution network, the company is evaluating how to efficiently supply seven retail stores from seven available distribution centers. Each distribution center has a unique opening cost and capacity that limits the volume of goods it can distribute. Additionally, the cost to transport goods from these centers to each retail store varies, making the task of minimizing the overall operational cost a complex puzzle. The goal is to determine the optimal setup that satisfies the demand at each retail store while incurring the lowest possible total cost, including both the opening of selected distribution centers and the transportation of goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 7\n- Number of Retail Stores to be Supplied: 7\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7\n- From Center 2: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7\n- From Center 3: $5 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7\n- From Center 4: $4 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $1 to Store 6, $3 to Store 7\n- From Center 5: $5 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $1 to Store 7\n- From Center 6: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7\n- From Center 7: $4 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $1 to Store 7\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 961\n- Store 2: 787\n- Store 3: 401\n- Store 4: 789\n- Store 5: 965\n- Store 6: 505\n- Store 7: 876\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1502\n- Center 2: 1201\n- Center 3: 1529\n- Center 4: 961\n- Center 5: 1001\n- Center 6: 1795\n- Center 7: 1069\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for WareCo to meet the demand at all seven retail stores, considering both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",

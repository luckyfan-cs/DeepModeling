  "en_question": "A 9.026-kg object is suspended from a spring that stretches the spring by 1 m. The system is in a medium where the resistance to motion is proportional to velocity and equivalent to \\(6.552 \\, \\text{N} / (\\text{m/s})\\). Initially, the object is displaced 4.884 m above its equilibrium position and released with an initial upward velocity of 4.443 m/s. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t = 3 seconds rounded to three significant figures.",

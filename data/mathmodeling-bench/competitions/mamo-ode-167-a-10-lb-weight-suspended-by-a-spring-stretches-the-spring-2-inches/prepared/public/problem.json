  "Question": "A 10-lb weight suspended by a spring stretches the spring 2 inches. The system experiences resistance proportional to velocity, equivalent to \\(20 / \\sqrt{g}\\) lb times the velocity in feet per second. When the weight is pulled down 3 inches below its equilibrium position and released without initial velocity, model the spring-mass system's vertical displacement. Assume downward as the positive direction. Provide the displacement a t = 0.1s in inches, rounded to three significant figures.",

  "Question": "A bustling city has a population of 10,000 people. The population grows naturally at a rate of 2% per year, but the city also experiences a yearly outflow of people moving out, which can be modeled by the function f(t) = -t, where t is the number of years since the current year. What is the population of the city after 2 year, rounded to the nearest whole number? Keep 5 significant figures.",

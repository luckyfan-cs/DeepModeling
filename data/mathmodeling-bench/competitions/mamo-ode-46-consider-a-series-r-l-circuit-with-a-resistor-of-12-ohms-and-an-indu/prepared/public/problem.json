  "Question": "Consider a series R-L circuit with a resistor of 12 Ohms and an inductor of 4 H. A battery provides a constant voltage of 60 V. When the switch is closed at t=0, the current starts from I(0)=0. Calculate the limiting value of the current as t approaches infinity (in A). Keep 1 significant figures.",

  "Question": "For small, slowly falling objects, the assumption made in the text that the drag force is proportional to the velocity is a good one. For larger, more rapidly falling objects, it is more accurate to assume that the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity.  If m = 10 kg, the drag coefficient is 10g/2401 kg/m. Determine the limiting velocity in m/s after a long time. Keep three significant digit number in answer.",

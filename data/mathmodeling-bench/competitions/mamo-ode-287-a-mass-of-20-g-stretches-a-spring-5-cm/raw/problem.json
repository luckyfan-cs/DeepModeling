  "en_question": "A mass of 20 g stretches a spring 5 cm. Suppose that the mass is also attached to a viscous damper with a damping constant of 400 dyn \u00b7 s/cm. If the mass is pulled down an additional 2 cm and then released, find its position u at any time t. Determine the distance between its position after 0.1s and equilibrium position in inch.

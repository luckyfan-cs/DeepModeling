  "en_question": "Imagine you have a tank initially holding 100 gallons of fresh water. You start adding water with a salt concentration of 1/2 pound of salt per gallon at a constant flow rate of 2 gallons per minute. This process continues for 20 minutes. The salty water is mixed thoroughly with the existing water in the tank, and the mixed solution is allowed to flow out of the tank at the same rate to keep the total volume constant. Assume the mixing process is instantaneous and uniform, meaning the concentration of salt is the same throughout the solution at any given moment. Your task is to determine the amount of salt, in pounds, in the tank at the end of the 20 minutes, given the described process of adding salty water for 20 minutes, all while maintaining a constant flow rate and tank volume. Keep four siginificant digit in the answer.",

  "en_question": "A spring-mass system is designed with a 7.437 kg weight that naturally stretches the spring by 6.792 meters. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is 7.968 times the velocity of the weight. Starting from a point 3 meters above the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 3.997 m/s, assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=3 seconds. Provide your answer in meters, rounded to four significant figures.",

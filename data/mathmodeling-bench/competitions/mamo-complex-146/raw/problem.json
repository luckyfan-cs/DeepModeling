The company must navigate through the maze of potential costs to find the most economical route that ensures all retail stores' demands are satisfied without excess.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for MegaMart to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands, considering both the opening and transportation costs?\n\nThis question seeks a singular answer, the minimum possible total cost, encapsulating the strategic decision-making challenge MegaMart faces.",

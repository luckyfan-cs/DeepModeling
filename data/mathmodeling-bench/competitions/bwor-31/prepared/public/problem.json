Product II requires 15,000 units per month from March to September, and 50,000 units per month in other months.The production costs of the factory for the two products are: For product I: 5 yuan per unit if produced from January to May; 4.50 yuan per unit if produced from June to December. For product II: 8 yuan per unit if produced from January to May; 7 yuan per unit if produced from June to December. The total monthly production capacity of the factory for both products must not exceed 120,000 units. The volume per unit is 0.2 m³ for product I and 0.4 m³ for product II, and the factory’s warehouse volume capacity is 15,000 m³. Requirements:(a) Show that the above problem has no feasible solution.(b) If the factory’s warehouse is insufficient, storage space can be rented from an external factory. If using the in-house warehouse, the cost per m³ per month is 1 yuan; if renting from an external warehouse, the cost increases to 1.5 yuan per m³ per month. Under the condition of meeting market demand, determine how the factory should schedule production to minimize the total cost of production and inventory storage. \n",

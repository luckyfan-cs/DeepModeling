  "Question": "In a series circuit with an inductor, resistor, and capacitor initially open, a capacitor holds a charge of \\(2\\) coulombs, and a current of \\(3\\) amperes flows at the instant the circuit is closed. An external voltage of \\(E(t)=20 \\cos t\\) is applied. The voltage drop across the resistor equals 4 times the rate of change of charge, across the capacitor equals 10 times the charge, and across the inductor equals 2 times the rate of change in current. Calculate the charge on the capacitor at \\(t=10\\) seconds. Assume the direction of current flow from the positive to the negative terminal as positive. Provide your answers in coulombs for the charge, rounded to three significant figures.",

  "en_question": "Let $h(t)$ be the height of a certain liquid in a cylindrical tank at time $t$. The tank has a radius of 2 meters. There is a circular hole at the bottom of the tank through which the liquid drains out. The area of this hole is $0.966 \\mathrm{m}^2$. By applying Torricelli's law, we know that the rate at which liquid flows from the tank is proportional to the square root of its height. Assuming that gravity $g$ is $9.81 \\mathrm{m/s}^2$, and that initially at time $t=0$, the tank was full with a height of 19 meters, calculate the height of liquid left in the tank after 7 seconds. Provide your answer in meters and to two decimal places.",

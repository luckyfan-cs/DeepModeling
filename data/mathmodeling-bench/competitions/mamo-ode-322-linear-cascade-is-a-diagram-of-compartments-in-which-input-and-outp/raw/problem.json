  "en_question": "linear cascade is a diagram of compartments in which input and output rates have been assigned from one or more different compartments. The diagram is a succinct way to summarize and document the various rates. The method of compartment analysis translates the diagram into a system of linear differential equations. The method has been used to derive applied models in diverse topics like ecology, chemistry, heating and cooling, kinetics, mechanics and electricity.  A compartment diagram consists of the following components. There are three tanks in the system, labeled as x_1 , x_2, and x_3, which represent the amount of a substance (like salt) in each tank at any given time t. Tank x_1 is the first tank, receiving an inflow of fluid with a concentration of 0 (zero) of the substance being tracked. This could imply that the fluid entering is pure water with no salt in the case of a brine system. The flow of fluid from tank x_1 to tank x_2 occurs at a rate of x_1/2, suggesting that the outflow rate from tank x_1 is half the instantaneous amount of the substance in tank x_1. This indicates that the fluid's flow rate is proportional to the amount of substance in tank x_1. Tank x_2 receives the outflow from tank x_1 and in turn has an outflow to tank x_3 at a rate of x_2/4, indicating the flow rate from tank x_2 to tank x_3 is a quarter of the instantaneous amount of the substance in tank x_2. Finally, tank x_3 has an outflow at a rate of x_3/6, meaning that its outflow rate is one-sixth of the instantaneous amount of the substance in tank x_3. Assume the initial salt in x_1 is 15 pounds, the initial salt in x_2 is 25 pounds, the initial salt in x_3 is 20 pounds. Assembly of the single linear differential equation for a diagram compartment X is done by writing dX/dt for the left side of the differential equation and then algebraically adding the input and output rates to obtain the right side of the differential equation, according to the balance law dX/dt = sum of input rates - sum of output rates. Find the pounds of salt in the tank3 at t = 5s. Keep three significant digit number in answer.",

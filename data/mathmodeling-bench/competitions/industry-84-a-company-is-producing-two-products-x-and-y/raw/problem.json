  "en_question": "A company is producing two products (X and Y). The resources required for the production of X and Y are divided into two parts: machine time for automated processing and craftsman time for manual finishing. The table below shows the number of minutes required for each product:\n\n| Item | Machine Time (minutes) | Craftsman Time (minutes) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| X | 13 | 20 |\n| Y | 19 | 29 |\n\nThe company has 40 hours of machine time available in the next working week, but only 35 hours of craftsman time. The cost of machine time is \u00a310 per hour, and the cost of craftsman time is \u00a32 per hour. Idle time for machines and craftsmen incurs no cost. For each product produced (all products produced will be sold), the revenue for product X is \u00a320, and the revenue for product Y is \u00a330. The company has a specific contract that requires 10 units of product X to be produced for a customer each week. Formulate a model for this problem.",

  "en_question": "A spring system is designed with an 8-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring 4 ft. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is 1.5 times the velocity of the weight. Starting from a point 2 ft above the spring's equilibrium position and moving downward at a speed of 3 ft/sec. Assuming upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=0.25 seconds.Provide the displacement in feet, rounded to four significant figures.",

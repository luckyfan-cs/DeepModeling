  "en_question": "Consider a vessel of water containing a radioactive isotope, to be used as a tracer for the food chain, which consists of aquatic plankton varieties A and B. Plankton are aquatic organisms that drift with the currents, typically in an environment like Chesapeake Bay. Plankton can be divided into two groups, phytoplankton and zooplankton. The phytoplankton are plant-like drifters: diatoms and other alga. Zooplankton are animal-like drifters: copepods, larvae, and small crustaceans. Let x(t) = isotope concentration in the water, y(t) = isotope concentration in A, z(t) = isotope concentration in B. In our ecosystem simulation, we start with an environment where the water initially contains 20 mol/L of a radioactive isotope, while plankton varieties A and B have yet to absorb any. The dynamics of the isotope's distribution are governed by its interaction with the water and plankton: it decays or is absorbed from the water at a rate of 3 times its concentration per hour, illustrating a rapid decrease. Plankton A and B re-introduce the isotope back into the water at rates of 6 and 5 times their respective concentrations per hour, representing processes like excretion or decay. Plankton A absorbs the isotope efficiently from the water at twice the water's isotope concentration, but also loses it quickly at 12 times its own concentration due to factors like metabolic processing. Plankton B has a slower absorption rate from the water (once its concentration per hour) but interacts with Plankton A, absorbing isotopes at 6 times A's concentration, and loses isotopes at 5 times its concentration, reflecting a balance of absorption and loss mechanisms. This setup allows us to observe how the isotope spreads through the ecosystem, particularly focusing on its concentration in Plankton A after 2 hours, given these detailed interactions and initial conditions in mol/L.

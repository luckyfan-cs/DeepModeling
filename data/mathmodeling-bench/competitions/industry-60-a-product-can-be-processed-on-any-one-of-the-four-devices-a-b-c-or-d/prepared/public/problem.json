  "en_question": "A product can be processed on any one of the four devices: A, B, C, or D. The preparation completion costs when each device is enabled, the unit production cost for the product, and the maximum processing capacity of each device are shown in Table 5-7. If 2000 units of the product need to be produced, how can the total cost be minimized? Try to establish a mathematical model.\n\nTable 5-7\n| Device | Prep Completion Cost (Yuan) | Unit Production Cost (Yuan/Unit) | Maximum Processing Capacity (Units) |\n|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| A      | 1000                         | 20                               | 900                                |\n| B      | 920                          | 24                               | 1000                               |\n| C      | 800                          | 16                               | 1200                               |\n| D      | 700                          | 28                               | 1600                               |",

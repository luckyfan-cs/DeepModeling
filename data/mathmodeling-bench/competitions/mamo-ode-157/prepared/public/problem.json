  "Question": "Consider a spring system with a 2-kg mass that requires a force of $13$ N to maintain a stretch of $0.25$ m beyond its natural length. The system has a damping constant of $c = 8$. Starting from the equilibrium position, if the mass is given an initial velocity of $0.5$ m/s, calculate its position relative to the spring's natural length at time $t = 2$ seconds, with the direction away from the spring's fixed point defined as positive. Express the position in meters, rounded to three significant figures.",

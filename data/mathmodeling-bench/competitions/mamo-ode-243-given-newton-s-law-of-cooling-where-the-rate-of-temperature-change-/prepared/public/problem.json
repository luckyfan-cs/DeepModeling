  "Question": "Given Newton's law of cooling, where the rate of temperature change of an object is proportional to the difference between its temperature and the ambient temperature, suppose you have a cup of coffee initially at 200°F. It cools to 190°F within the first minute in a room at 70°F. Determine the temperature  in F of the coffee after 6.07 minutes. Keep four significant digit number in answer.",

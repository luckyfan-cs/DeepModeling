  "en_question": "A blacksmith heats a piece of iron to 111\u00b0C and then leaves it in a room at a constant temperature of 23\u00b0C. After 14 minutes, the temperature of the iron is measured again and found to be 41.603\u00b0C. If the cooling process follows Newton's Law of Cooling, calculate the temperature of the iron after 20 minutes. Provide your answer in \u00b0C and in five significant figures.",

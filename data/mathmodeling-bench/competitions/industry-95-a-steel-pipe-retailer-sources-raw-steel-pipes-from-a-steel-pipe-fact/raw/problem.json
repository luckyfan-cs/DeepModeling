  "en_question": "A steel pipe retailer sources raw steel pipes from a steel pipe factory, cuts the pipes according to customer requirements, and sells them. The raw steel pipes obtained from the factory are all 1850 mm in length. A customer now needs 15 pieces of 290 mm, 28 pieces of 315 mm, 21 pieces of 350 mm, and 30 pieces of 455 mm steel pipes. To simplify the production process, it is required that no more than 4 types of cutting patterns are used. The most frequently used cutting pattern incurs an additional cost of 1/10 of the value of a raw steel pipe, the second most frequent incurs an additional cost of 2/10, and so on. Moreover, the number of cuts for each pattern cannot be too many (a single raw steel pipe can produce up to 5 products). Additionally, to minimize waste, the leftover material for each cutting pattern should not exceed 100 mm. How should the material be cut to minimize total cost, and what is the total cost in this case?",

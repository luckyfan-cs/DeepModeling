  "en_question": "In the bustling market landscape of SupplyChainVille, the logistics company LogiTech has embarked on a mission to efficiently distribute its products to nine retail stores scattered across the town. The challenge at hand is to select from eight potential distribution centers, each with its unique operational cost and a maximum supply capacity. The objective is clear: to minimize the total operational cost, which includes both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of shipping goods to the retail stores.\n\nGiven Data:\n\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 8\n- Number of Retail Stores to be Supplied: 9\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n- Center 8: $186,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1 to Stores: $2 to $5, varying per store\n- From Center 2 to Stores: $1 to $5, varying per store\n- From Center 3 to Stores: $1 to $4, varying per store\n- From Center 4 to Stores: $1 to $5, varying per store\n- From Center 5 to Stores: $1 to $5, varying per store\n- From Center 6 to Stores: $1 to $5, varying per store\n- From Center 7 to Stores: $2 to $5, varying per store\n- From Center 8 to Stores: $1 to $5, varying per store\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 779 units\n- Store 2: 892 units\n- Store 3: 440 units\n- Store 4: 556 units\n- Store 5: 414 units\n- Store 6: 464 units\n- Store 7: 920 units\n- Store 8: 743 units\n- Store 9: 528 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1447 units\n- Center 2: 1886 units\n- Center 3: 1962 units\n- Center 4: 1392 units\n- Center 5: 1191 units\n- Center 6: 1218 units\n- Center 7: 1088 units\n- Center 8: 1178 units\n\nThe conundrum LogiTech must solve revolves around which distribution centers to activate and how to route the distribution of products such that all retail stores' demands are met at the lowest possible total cost. This puzzle encapsulates not just the hefty opening costs of the distribution centers but also the intricate web of transportation costs associated with moving goods to each retail store.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for LogiTech to open distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands, considering both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",

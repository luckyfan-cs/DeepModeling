  "Question": "A spring with a natural length of $0.75$ m and a mass of $5$ kg attached to its end requires a force of $25$ N to maintain a stretch of $1$ m. If the spring is initially stretched to $1.1$ m and then released from rest, calculate the position of the mass relative to the natural length of the spring after $2$ seconds, with the direction away from the spring's fixed point defined as positive. Provide your answer in meters to four significant figures.",

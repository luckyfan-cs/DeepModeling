  "en_question": "A spring system is constructed with a 3-lb weight that naturally stretches the spring by 2 inches. The system encounters resistance in a medium that is proportional to the velocity of the weight, equivalent to \\(1.542 / \\sqrt{g}\\) lb times the velocity in feet per second. Starting from a point 0.337 ft below the spring's equilibrium position and moving upward at a speed of 0.843 ft/sec, calculate the displacement of the weight from its equilibrium position at t=5 seconds. Considering upward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction, provide your answer in feet, rounded to three significant figures.",

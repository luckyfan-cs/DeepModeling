  "en_question": "In a series circuit featuring a resistor of $R=24 \\Omega$, an inductor of $L=2 \\mathrm{H}$, a capacitor of $C=0.005 \\mathrm{F}$, and powered by a $12-\\mathrm{V}$ battery, with an initial charge on the capacitor of $Q=0.001 \\mathrm{C}$ and an initial current of 0, determine the current through the circuit at time $t=0.05$ seconds. The function that describes the current's time evolution in this circuit setting is based on the circuit's electrical properties. Calculate the current's value in Amperes, rounded to four significant figures.",

  "Question": "A 4.813 kg weight is attached to a spring and suspended in a medium that provides resistance proportional to the instantaneous velocity of the weight, with a constant of proportionality equal to 1.169 Ns/m. The spring has a stiffness of 8.83 N/m. If at time t=0, the weight is displaced 1.363 m above its equilibrium position and given an initial upward velocity of 3.928 m/s, what is the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=3 seconds? Note: Upward direction is considered positive here and provide your answer in meters rounded to three significant figures.",

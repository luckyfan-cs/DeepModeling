  "en_question": "Consider a typical home with attic, basement and insulated main floor. Typical home with attic and basement. The below-grade basement and the attic are un-insulated. Only the main living area is insulated. It is usual to surround the main living area with insulation, but the attic area has walls and ceiling without insulation. The walls and floor in the basement are insulated by earth. The basement ceiling is insulated by air space in the joists, a layer of flooring on the main floor and a layer of drywall in the basement. We will analyze the changing temperatures in the three levels using Newton\u2019s cooling law and the variables z(t) = Temperature in the attic, y(t) = Temperature in the main living area, x(t) = Temperature in the basement, t = Time in hours. Initial data. Assume it is winter time and the outside temperature in constantly 35\u25e6F during the day. Also assumed is a basement earth temperature of 45\u25e6F. Initially, the heat is off for several days. The initial values at noon (t = 0) are then x(0) = 45, y(0) = z(0) = 35. A small electric heater is turned on at noon, with thermostat set for 100\u25e6F. When the heater is running, it provides a 20\u25e6F rise per hour, therefore it takes some time to reach 100\u25e6F (probably never!). Newton\u2019s cooling law Temperature rate = k(Temperature difference) will be applied to five boundary surfaces: (0) the basement walls and floor, (1) the basement ceiling, (2) the main floor walls, (3) the main floor ceiling, and (4) the attic walls and ceiling. Newton\u2019s cooling law gives positive cooling constants k0, k1, k2, k3, k4. The insulation constants will be defined as k0 = 1/2, k1 = 1/2, k2 = 1/4, k3 = 1/4, k4 = 1/2 to reflect insulation quality. The reciprocal 1/k is approximately the amount of time in hours required for 63% of the temperature difference to be exchanged. What's the temperatures in F of main living area hover around at infinity. Keep four significant digit number in answer.",

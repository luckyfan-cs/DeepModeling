  "en_question": "A spring system, featuring a 10-kg mass connected to a spring with a spring constant of \\(140 \\mathrm{N} / \\mathrm{m}\\), is set into motion from its equilibrium position with an initial upward velocity of \\(1 \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{sec}\\). The system, placed in a viscous medium offering resistance of \\(90 \\mathrm{N}-\\mathrm{sec} / \\mathrm{m}\\), is subjected to an external force \\(f(t)=5 \\sin t\\) (in Newtons). Develop a model to describe the mass's vertical motion over time. Calculate the vertical displacement from the equilibrium position at \\(t = 0.5\\) seconds, assuming upward as the positive direction. Provide your answer in meters, rounded to four significant figures.",

  "en_question": "In an intricate dance of supply chain optimization, GlobalSupply Inc. is at a crossroads, tasked with the pivotal decision of efficiently distributing its products to seven distinct retail stores. This challenge is compounded by the need to select the most cost-effective combination of distribution centers from a pool of nine potential sites. Each potential distribution center is not only geographically unique but also comes with its own set of opening costs and maximum supply capacities. Additionally, the transportation cost per unit of product varies significantly from one distribution center to another, adding layers of complexity to the decision-making process.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 9\n- Number of Retail Stores in Need of Supply: 7\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n- Center 8: $186,000\n- Center 9: $174,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, etc.\n- From Center 2: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, etc.\n- Continuing similarly for all distribution centers to all stores.\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 695\n- Store 2: 737\n- Store 3: 452\n- Store 4: 616\n- Store 5: 587\n- Store 6: 779\n- Store 7: 892\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1864\n- Center 2: 1980\n- Center 3: 814\n- Center 4: 864\n- Center 5: 1320\n- Center 6: 1952\n- Center 7: 1447\n- Center 8: 1886\n- Center 9: 1962\n\nThe ultimate goal for GlobalSupply Inc. is to fulfill the demand at each retail store while minimizing the total cost. This total cost encompasses both the opening costs of selecting certain distribution centers and the ongoing transportation costs associated with moving goods from these centers to the retail stores.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for GlobalSupply Inc. to open distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands, thereby minimizing the combination of opening and transportation costs?",

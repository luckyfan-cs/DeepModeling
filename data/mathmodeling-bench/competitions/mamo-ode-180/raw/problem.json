  "en_question": "Consider a spring-mass system consisting of a 1 kg mass attached to a spring with a spring constant of \\(1 \\mathrm{N} / \\mathrm{m}\\), immersed in a viscous medium with a damping constant of \\(2 \\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\mathrm{s} / \\mathrm{m}\\). Initially, the mass is positioned \\(1/4\\) meter below its equilibrium position and given an upward velocity of \\(1 \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{s}\\) at time \\(t=0\\). Determine the function that models the mass's movement over time. Calculate the mass's displacement from the equilibrium position at a given time \\(t\\), considering upward from the equilibrium position as positive. Provide the displacement in meters at \\(t = 2\\) seconds, rounded to three significant figures.",

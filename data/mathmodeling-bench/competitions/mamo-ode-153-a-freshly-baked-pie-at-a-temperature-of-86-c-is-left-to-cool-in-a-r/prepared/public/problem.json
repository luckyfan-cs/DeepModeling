  "Question": "A freshly baked pie at a temperature of 86°C is left to cool in a room where the ambient temperature is constant at 38°C. The rate constant \\(k\\) for the cooling process, according to Newton's Law of Cooling, is found to be \\(0.146 \\, \\text{min}^{-1}\\). Calculate the temperature of the pie after 19 minutes. Provide your answer in °C and rounded to three decimal places.",

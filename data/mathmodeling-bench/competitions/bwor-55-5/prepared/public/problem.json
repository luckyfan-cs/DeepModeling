  "en_question": "\n\n5.25 A master’s student majoring in Operations Research at a university is required to choose from the following seven courses: Calculus, Operations Research, Data Structures, Managerial Statistics, Computer Simulation, Computer Programming, and Forecasting. Among these, the student must select two Mathematics courses, two Operations Research courses, and two Computer Science courses. Some courses belong to only one category: Calculus is a Mathematics course, and Computer Programming is a Computer Science course. However, some courses span multiple categories: Operations Research counts as both Operations Research and Mathematics; Data Structures belong to both Computer Science and Mathematics; Managerial Statistics belong to both Mathematics and Operations Research; Computer Simulation belongs to both Computer Science and Operations Research; Forecasting belongs to both Operations Research and Mathematics. If a course falls into two categories, selecting it counts as one course in each of those two categories.In addition, some courses have prerequisites: to take Computer Simulation or Data Structures, one must first take Computer Programming; to take Managerial Statistics, one must first take Calculus; and to take Forecasting, one must first take Managerial Statistics.Question: What is the minimum number of courses a master’s student must take, and which courses must be taken, in order to meet the above requirements? \n\n",
  "cn_question": "\n\n5.25某大学运筹学专业硕士:生要求从微积分、运筹学、数据结构、管理统计、计算机模拟、计算机程序、预测共7门课程中必须选修两门数学类、两门运筹学类和两门计算机类课程，课程中有些只归属某一类：微积分归属数学类，计算机程序归属计算机类；但有些课程是跨类的：运筹学可归为运筹学类和数学类，数据结构归属计算机类和数学类，管理统计归属数学和运筹学类,计算机模拟归属计算机类和运筹学类,预测归属运筹学类和数学类，凡归属两类的课程选学后可认为两类中各学了一门课。此外有些课程要求先学习先修课：计算机模拟或数据结构必须先修计算机程序，学管理统计须先修微积分,学预测必须先修管理统计。问：一个硕士生最少应学几门及哪几门,才能满足上述要求？\n\n",

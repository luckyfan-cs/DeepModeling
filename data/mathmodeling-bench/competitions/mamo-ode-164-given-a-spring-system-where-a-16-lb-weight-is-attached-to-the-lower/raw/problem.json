  "en_question": "Given a spring system where a 16-lb weight is attached to the lower end of a coil spring suspended from the ceiling, with the spring having a constant of 1 lb/ft, and the system's resistance equal to 15 times the instantaneous velocity. If at time t=0, the weight is released from 2 ft below its equilibrium position with a downward velocity of 2 ft/s, model this physical situation with an initial value problem and solve for the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=0.5 seconds. Considering downward from the equilibrium position as the positive direction. Provide the answer in ft, rounded to four significant figures.",

  "en_question": "A spring-mass-damper system is designed with a 9.673-lb weight attached to a coil spring. The damping constant of the system is 9.494 lb-ft/s and the spring constant is 8.025 lb/ft. At time t=0, the weight is released from a height of 3.98 ft above its equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 4.546 ft/s (considering upward as positive). Model this physical situation with an initial value problem and solve for the displacement from the equilibrium position at t=4 seconds. Provide your answer in feet, rounded to three significant figures.",

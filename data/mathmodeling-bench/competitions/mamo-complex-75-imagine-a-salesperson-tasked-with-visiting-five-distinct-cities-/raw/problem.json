  "en_question": "Imagine a salesperson tasked with visiting five distinct cities to expand their business network. These cities are uniquely identified as City 1, City 2, City 3, City 4, and City 5. The salesperson is free to choose any of these cities as the starting point. However, they must travel to each city exactly once, concluding their journey at the starting city. The primary objective is to minimize the total travel cost associated with the entire trip, which includes expenses such as transportation costs between the cities.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the travel costs between the cities:\n- The cost to travel from City 1 to City 2 is 87 units, to City 3 is 41 units, to City 4 is 55 units, and to City 5 is 57 units.\n- From City 2, it costs 87 units to reach City 1, 80 units to travel to City 3, 33 units to City 4, and 40 units to City 5.\n- Traveling from City 3, the costs are 41 units to City 1, 80 units to City 2, 90 units to City 4, and 42 units to City 5.\n- From City 4, the journey costs 55 units to City 1, 33 units to City 2, 90 units to City 3, and 53 units to City 5.\n- Lastly, from City 5, it costs 57 units to travel to City 1, 40 units to City 2, 42 units to City 3, and 53 units to City 4.\n\nGiven this cost matrix, what is the minimum total travel cost for the salesperson to visit each city exactly once and return to the starting city?",

  "en_question": "A company specializing in foldable tables needs to create an optimal production and human resources plan for a six-month period (January to June) to maximize its total net profit. The plan must detail monthly in-house production levels, outsourcing quantities, and workforce management (hiring/firing).\n\n**Initial Conditions (at the start of January):**\n- Initial Workforce: 1,000 employees\n- Initial Inventory: 15,000 units\n\n**Revenue and Cost Structure:**\n- **Sales Price:** 300 Yuan per unit sold.\n- **Raw Material Cost:** 90 Yuan per unit, applicable *only* to units produced in-house.\n- **Outsourcing Cost:** 200 Yuan per unit for finished tables acquired from a third-party supplier. This is an all-inclusive cost.\n- **Inventory Holding Cost:** 15 Yuan per unit for any inventory held at the end of a month.\n- **Backorder Cost:** 35 Yuan per unit for any unfulfilled demand (stockout) carried over to the next month.\n\n**Labor and Production Parameters:**\n- **Labor Requirement:** Each in-house unit requires 5 labor hours to produce.\n- **Regular Labor:** Each worker provides 160 regular working hours per month (8 hours/day * 20 days/month). The company pays a regular wage of 30 Yuan/hour for these 160 hours, regardless of full utilization.\n- **Overtime Labor:** Workers can perform overtime. Total overtime hours per month for the entire workforce cannot exceed 20 hours per worker. The overtime wage is 40 Yuan/hour.\n- **Workforce Management:** The company can hire or fire workers each month. The cost to hire a new worker is 5,000 Yuan, and the cost to fire a worker is 8,000 Yuan.\n\n**Demand and Fulfillment Logic:**\n- Unfulfilled demand from one month is back-ordered and must be met in subsequent months.\n- The company fulfills orders (both current demand and backorders) using available inventory from the previous month, current in-house production, and outsourced units.\n\n**Terminal Condition (at the end of June):**\n- The ending inventory must be at least 10,000 units.\n- All backorders must be cleared (i.e., ending backorders must be zero).\n\n**Forecasted Demand:**\n| Month | January | February | March | April | May | June |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| Demand Forecast | 20,000 | 40,000 | 42,000 | 35,000 | 19,000 | 18,500 |\n\nBased on this information, formulate the optimal six-month operational plan.",

  "en_question": "In network communication services, bandwidth plays an important role. Below is a bandwidth communication table between several communication nodes, showing the bandwidth between any two nodes. If two nodes cannot be directly connected, the corresponding bandwidth is $0$. It is required to establish a link between node $A$ and node $E$ that must pass through service node $C$ (without loops). The bandwidth of this link is defined as the minimum bandwidth value on the link. Please propose a reasonable link arrangement to maximize the bandwidth of this link and find out the maximum bandwidth.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n        \\hline\n        & A & B & C & D & E \\\\\n        \\hline\n        A & 0 & 90 & 85 & 0 & 65 \\\\\n        \\hline\n        B & 95 & 0 & 70 & 65 & 34 \\\\\n        \\hline\n        C & 60 & 0 & 0 & 88 & 80 \\\\\n        \\hline\n        D & 67 & 30 & 25 & 0 & 84 \\\\\n        \\hline\n        E & 0 & 51 & 0 & 56 & 0 \\\\\n        \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}",

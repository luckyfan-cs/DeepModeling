The processing time, profit from sales, and the maximum weekly processing capacity for each type are shown in Table 3.1.\n\nTable 3.1\n\n| Process | Model |  | Maximum Weekly Processing Capacity |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  | $\\\\mathrm{A}$ | $\\\\mathrm{B}$ |  |\n| I (hours / unit) | 4 | 6 | 150 |\n| II (hours / unit) | 3 | 2 | 70 |\n| Profit ($ per unit) | 300 | 450 |  |\n\nThe expected values for the factory's operational goals are as follows:\n\n$p_{1}$: The total weekly profit must not be less than $10,000.\n\n$p_{2}$: Due to contractual requirements, at least 10 units of Model A and at least 15 units of Model B must be produced per week.\n\n$p_{3}$: The weekly production time for Process I should be exactly 150 hours, and the production time for Process II should be fully utilized, with potential overtime if necessary.\n\nTry to establish the mathematical programming model for this problem.",

    "prompt": "# Industry 3 A Farmer Needs To Decide How Many Cows Sheep And Chickens To Raise In\n\nA farmer needs to decide how many cows, sheep, and chickens to raise in order to achieve maximum profit. The farmer can sell cows, sheep, and chickens for $500, $200, and $8 each, respectively. The feed costs for each cow, sheep, and chicken are $100, $80, and $5, respectively. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the feed cost. Each cow, sheep, and chicken produces 10, 5, and 3 units of manure per day, respectively. Due to the limited time the farm staff has for cleaning the farm each day, they can handle up to 800 units of manure. Additionally, because of the limited farm size, the farmer can raise at most 50 chickens. Furthermore, the farmer must have at least 10 cows to meet customer demand. The farmer must also raise at least 20 sheep. Finally, the total number of animals cannot exceed 100.\n\n### Submission Format\n- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.\n- The answer must use the template `@profit[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.\n\n### Evaluation\n- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.\n\n        Additional instructions:\n        - All prepared input files are located under `/home/aiops/liufan/projects/DeepModeling/data/engineering-bench/competitions/industry-3/prepared/public`.\n        - Use `sample_submission.csv` as the schema reference for your prediction file.\n        - Save your final predictions to `submission.csv` in the current working directory.\n        - Keep the Scientific Method structure in your reasoning before running experiments."

Failure to adhere to this format will result in a score of zero.\n\n\n**Required Submission Columns:**\nYour submission file MUST contain the following columns in this exact order:\n```\n['id', 'answer']\n```\nThis is a strict requirement for the submission to be graded correctly. The grading system uses the non-prediction columns (like 'Comment' or an 'id') to match your predictions against the ground truth.\n\n\n**Format Details:**\n*First 5 rows:*\n```text\n id        answer\n  0 @profit[0.00]\n```\n\n*Data types:*\n```text\nid         int64\nanswer    object\n```\n\n\n\n",

The cost of ordering each chair from manufacturer A is $50, from manufacturer B is $45, and from manufacturer C is $40. The store needs to minimize the total cost of the order.\n\nAdditionally, each order from manufacturer A will include 15 chairs, while each order from manufacturers B and C will include 10 chairs. The number of orders must be an integer. The store needs to order at least 100 chairs.\n\nEach order from manufacturer A will include 15 chairs, while each order from manufacturers B and C will include 10 chairs. The store needs to order at most 500 chairs.\n\nIf the store decides to order chairs from manufacturer A, it must also order at least 10 chairs from manufacturer B.\n\nFurthermore, if the store decides to order chairs from manufacturer B, it must also order chairs from manufacturer C.\n\n### Submission Format\n- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.\n- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.\n\n### Evaluation\n- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.\n\n        Additional instructions:\n        - All prepared input files are located under `/home/aiops/liufan/projects/DeepModeling/data/engineering-bench/competitions/industry-18/prepared/public`.\n        - Use `sample_submission.csv` as the schema reference for your prediction file.\n        - Save your final predictions to `submission.csv` in the current working directory.\n        - Keep the Scientific Method structure in your reasoning before running experiments.\n\n\n\n--- COMPREHENSIVE DATA REPORT ---\n\n## Directory Structure (Current Working Directory)\n```text\n./\n├── problem.json\n└── sample_submission.csv\n```\n\n## Submission Format Requirements\n\n**CRITICAL:** Your final submission file MUST EXACTLY match the format of the sample submission file provided (`sample_submission.csv`).\nThis includes the column names, column order, and data types. Failure to adhere to this format will result in a score of zero.\n\n\n**Required Submission Columns:**\nYour submission file MUST contain the following columns in this exact order:\n```\n['id', 'answer']\n```\nThis is a strict requirement for the submission to be graded correctly. The grading system uses the non-prediction columns (like 'Comment' or an 'id') to match your predictions against the ground truth.\n\n\n**Format Details:**\n*First 5 rows:*\n```text\n id      answer\n  0 @cost[0.00]\n```\n\n*Data types:*\n```text\nid         int64\nanswer    object\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nI/O Requirements:\n\n--- CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS ---\n\nYou MUST follow these file system rules precisely. Failure to do so will cause a fatal error.\n\n1. **INPUT DATA:**\n   - All input files are located in the **current working directory** (./).\n   - Example: Use `pd.read_csv('train.csv')`.\n\n2. **OUTPUT FILE:**\n   - You MUST save your final submission file to the **current working directory** (./).\n   - The required output filename is: `submission.csv`\n   - **Correct Example:** `submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)`\n   - **Do NOT rename or relocate this file across iterations; always overwrite `./submission.csv`.**\n\n**IMPORTANT:** These path requirements are non-negotiable and must be followed exactly.\n\n\nStart by analyzing the phenomenon. Output ONLY:\n<Phenomenon>\nDescribe what you observe about this problem\n</Phenomenon>\n\nThen continue with hypothesis. Use these tags in order:\n<Hypothesis>Your hypothesis</Hypothesis>\n<Model>Formal model description</Model>\n<Experiment>\nPython code to test your hypothesis\n</Experiment>\n\nI will execute the code and give you the output in <Observation>."}}

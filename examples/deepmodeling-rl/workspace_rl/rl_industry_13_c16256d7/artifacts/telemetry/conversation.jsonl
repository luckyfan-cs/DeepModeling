She wants to choose a combination of protein and vegetables to maximize her protein intake for the meal. Her protein options are chicken, salmon, and tofu, which can be bought in any quantity.\n\n- Chicken: 23g protein, $3.00 cost, per 100g.\n- Salmon: 20g protein, $5.00 cost, per 100g.\n- Tofu: 8g protein, $1.50 cost, per 100g.\n\nShe also wants to choose from a list of five vegetables, sold in 100g packs. She must select at least three different types of vegetables.\n\n- Broccoli (100g pack): 2.8g protein, $1.20 cost.\n- Carrots (100g pack): 0.9g protein, $0.80 cost.\n- Spinach (100g pack): 2.9g protein, $1.50 cost.\n- Bell Pepper (100g pack): 1.0g protein, $1.00 cost.\n- Mushrooms (100g pack): 3.1g protein, $2.00 cost.\n\nMary has two main constraints:\n1. Her total budget is $20.\n2. The total weight of all food must not exceed 800 grams.\n\nHow should Mary choose her ingredients to get the maximum possible amount of protein?\n\n### Submission Format\n- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.\n- The answer must use the template `@cost[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.\n\n### Evaluation\n- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.\n\n        Additional instructions:\n        - All prepared input files are located under `/home/aiops/liufan/projects/DeepModeling/data/engineering-bench/competitions/industry-13/prepared/public`.\n        - Use `sample_submission.csv` as the schema reference for your prediction file.\n        - Save your final predictions to `submission.csv` in the current working directory.\n        - Keep the Scientific Method structure in your reasoning before running experiments.\n\n\n\n--- COMPREHENSIVE DATA REPORT ---\n\n## Directory Structure (Current Working Directory)\n```text\n./\n├── problem.json\n└── sample_submission.csv\n```\n\n## Submission Format Requirements\n\n**CRITICAL:** Your final submission file MUST EXACTLY match the format of the sample submission file provided (`sample_submission.csv`).\nThis includes the column names, column order, and data types. Failure to adhere to this format will result in a score of zero.\n\n\n**Required Submission Columns:**\nYour submission file MUST contain the following columns in this exact order:\n```\n['id', 'answer']\n```\nThis is a strict requirement for the submission to be graded correctly. The grading system uses the non-prediction columns (like 'Comment' or an 'id') to match your predictions against the ground truth.\n\n\n**Format Details:**\n*First 5 rows:*\n```text\n id      answer\n  0 @cost[0.00]\n```\n\n*Data types:*\n```text\nid         int64\nanswer    object\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nI/O Requirements:\n\n--- CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS ---\n\nYou MUST follow these file system rules precisely. Failure to do so will cause a fatal error.\n\n1. **INPUT DATA:**\n   - All input files are located in the **current working directory** (./).\n   - Example: Use `pd.read_csv('train.csv')`.\n\n2. **OUTPUT FILE:**\n   - You MUST save your final submission file to the **current working directory** (./).\n   - The required output filename is: `submission.csv`\n   - **Correct Example:** `submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)`\n   - **Do NOT rename or relocate this file across iterations; always overwrite `./submission.csv`.**\n\n**IMPORTANT:** These path requirements are non-negotiable and must be followed exactly.\n\n\nStart by analyzing the phenomenon. Output ONLY:\n<Phenomenon>\nDescribe what you observe about this problem\n</Phenomenon>\n\nThen continue with hypothesis.

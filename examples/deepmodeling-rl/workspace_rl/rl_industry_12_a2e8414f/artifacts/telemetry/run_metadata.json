The grading system uses the non-prediction columns (like 'Comment' or an 'id') to match your predictions against the ground truth.\n\n\n**Format Details:**\n*First 5 rows:*\n```text\n id        answer\n  0 @profit[0.00]\n```\n\n*Data types:*\n```text\nid         int64\nanswer    object\n```\n\n\n\n",

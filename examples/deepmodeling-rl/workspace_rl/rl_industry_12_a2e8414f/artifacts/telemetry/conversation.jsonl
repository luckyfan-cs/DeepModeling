The profit per acre for planting corn is $1500, the profit per acre for planting wheat is $1200, the profit per acre for planting soybeans is $1800, and the profit per acre for planting sorghum is $1600. To maximize their profit, how many acres of land should they allocate to each crop? Tom and Jerry’s farm has a total area of 100 acres.\n\nThe land area used for planting corn must be at least twice the land area used for planting wheat.\n\nThe land area used for planting soybeans must be at least half the land area used for planting sorghum.\n\nThe land area used for planting wheat must be three times the land area used for planting sorghum.\n\n### Submission Format\n- Provide a single row with `id` and `answer` columns.\n- The answer must use the template `@profit[value]`, where `value` is the numeric solution rounded as appropriate.\n\n### Evaluation\n- Submissions are evaluated using an exact-match checker with a small tolerance (±1e-2) on the reported value.\n\n        Additional instructions:\n        - All prepared input files are located under `/home/aiops/liufan/projects/DeepModeling/data/engineering-bench/competitions/industry-12/prepared/public`.\n        - Use `sample_submission.csv` as the schema reference for your prediction file.\n        - Save your final predictions to `submission.csv` in the current working directory.\n        - Keep the Scientific Method structure in your reasoning before running experiments.\n\n\n\n--- COMPREHENSIVE DATA REPORT ---\n\n## Directory Structure (Current Working Directory)\n```text\n./\n├── problem.json\n└── sample_submission.csv\n```\n\n## Submission Format Requirements\n\n**CRITICAL:** Your final submission file MUST EXACTLY match the format of the sample submission file provided (`sample_submission.csv`).\nThis includes the column names, column order, and data types. Failure to adhere to this format will result in a score of zero.\n\n\n**Required Submission Columns:**\nYour submission file MUST contain the following columns in this exact order:\n```\n['id', 'answer']\n```\nThis is a strict requirement for the submission to be graded correctly.
